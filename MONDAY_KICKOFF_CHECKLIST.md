## 🚨 Blockers to Escalate Immediately

If you encounter any of these, escalate to project lead:

1. **Can't install accessibility tools** - Need admin access
2. **Dev server won't start** - Blocking all testing
3. **Can't find Swahili speaker** - May need budget approval for paid service
4. **Leadership unavailable for review** - May delay marketing updates
5. **More violations than expected** - May need timeline adjustment

---

## 📊 Daily Standup Format

**What to report each day**:
1. What I completed yesterday
2. What I'm working on today
3. Any blockers or help needed
4. Estimated % complete

**Example**:
> Yesterday: Installed accessibility tools, tested Home page, found 15 violations
> Today: Testing Bills and Dashboard pages
> Blockers: None
> Progress: 20% complete (1 of 5 days)
