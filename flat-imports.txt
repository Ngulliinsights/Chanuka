## Summary

All searches returned zero results, indicating that all imports have already been updated to use structured paths (core/, query/, utils/).

## Filesystem Verification

The graph module directory was inspected and BOTH flat and structured files exist:

### Flat Files (at root level):
- neo4j-client.ts
- batch-sync-runner.ts
- sync-executor.ts
- transaction-executor.ts
- query-builder.ts
- session-manager.ts
- engagement-queries.ts
- network-queries.ts
- advanced-queries.ts
- schema.ts

### Structured Files (in subdirectories):
- core/neo4j-client.ts
- core/batch-sync-runner.ts
- core/sync-executor.ts
- core/transaction-executor.ts
- core/schema.ts
- utils/query-builder.ts
- utils/session-manager.ts
- query/engagement-queries.ts
- query/network-queries.ts
- query/advanced-queries.ts

## Conclusion

✅ **All imports have already been migrated to structured paths**
✅ **No import updates are needed (Task 2.2.4 can be skipped)**
✅ **Flat duplicate files are safe to delete (proceed with Task 2.2.7)**

The migration from flat to structured imports has already been completed. The flat files remain as duplicates that can now be safely removed.
