## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Staging Deployment

#### Step 1: Deploy to Staging
```bash
# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.0.0-analytics -m "Analytics module v1.0.0"

# Push to staging environment
git push origin v1.0.0-analytics

# Monitor deployment
kubectl get pods -l app=analytics -w
```

#### Step 2: Smoke Tests
```bash
# Test basic functionality
curl -f https://staging-api.example.com/api/analytics/stats

# Test authentication
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <test-token>" \
     https://staging-api.example.com/api/analytics/engagement/metrics

# Test data export (admin)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
     -X GET "https://staging-api.example.com/api/analytics/engagement/export?format=json"

# Test cache operations
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>" \
     -X DELETE https://staging-api.example.com/api/analytics/cache
```

#### Step 3: Load Testing
```bash
# Run load tests against staging
npm run test:load -- --environment=staging --duration=10m

# Verify performance metrics
# - p95 latency < 500ms
# - Error rate < 1%
# - Cache hit rate > 70%
```

#### Step 4: Integration Testing
```bash
# Test with dependent services
npm run test:integration -- --environment=staging

# Verify data consistency
# Check that analytics data matches production data structure
```

### Phase 2: Production Deployment

#### Step 2.1: Feature Flag Configuration
```bash
# Set feature flags for gradual rollout
export ANALYTICS_ENABLE_ML_ANALYSIS=false
export ANALYTICS_ENABLE_REAL_TIME_UPDATES=true
export ANALYTICS_ENABLE_ADVANCED_CACHING=true
export ANALYTICS_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=true
export ANALYTICS_ENABLE_ERROR_TRACKING=true

# Initial rollout percentage (if using feature flags)
export ANALYTICS_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE=10
```

#### Step 2.2: Blue-Green Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to blue environment
kubectl set image deployment/analytics-blue analytics=gcr.io/project/analytics:v1.0.0

# Wait for rollout to complete
kubectl rollout status deployment/analytics-blue

# Switch traffic to blue environment
kubectl patch service analytics -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"color":"blue"}}}'

# Monitor for 5 minutes
sleep 300

# Check error rates and latency
curl https://api.example.com/metrics | grep analytics
```

#### Step 2.3: Gradual Rollout
```bash
# Increase traffic percentage gradually
kubectl patch service analytics -p '{"spec":{"traffic":{"blue":20,"green":80}}}'

# Monitor for 10 minutes
sleep 600

# Continue gradual increase
kubectl patch service analytics -p '{"spec":{"traffic":{"blue":50,"green":50}}}'
sleep 600

kubectl patch service analytics -p '{"spec":{"traffic":{"blue":80,"green":20}}}'
sleep 600

# Full rollout
kubectl patch service analytics -p '{"spec":{"traffic":{"blue":100,"green":0}}}'
```

#### Step 2.4: Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Verify all endpoints respond
curl -f https://api.example.com/api/analytics/engagement/metrics
curl -f https://api.example.com/api/analytics/engagement/trends
curl -f https://api.example.com/api/analytics/stats

# Check monitoring dashboards
open https://monitoring.example.com/d/analytics-overview

# Verify metrics collection
curl https://api.example.com/metrics | grep -E "(analytics|cache|db)"
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (< 5 minutes impact)

#### Automated Rollback
```bash
# If automated monitoring detects critical issues
kubectl rollout undo deployment/analytics

# Or switch back to green environment
kubectl patch service analytics -p '{"spec":{"selector":{"color":"green"}}}'
```

#### Manual Rollback
```bash
# Roll back to previous deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/analytics --to-revision=1

# Wait for rollback to complete
kubectl rollout status deployment/analytics

# Verify rollback success
curl -f https://api.example.com/health
```

### Controlled Rollback (5-30 minutes impact)

#### Partial Rollback
```bash
# Reduce traffic to new version
kubectl patch service analytics -p '{"spec":{"traffic":{"blue":20,"green":80}}}'

# Monitor for stabilization
sleep 300

# Complete rollback if needed
kubectl patch service analytics -p '{"spec":{"traffic":{"blue":0,"green":100}}}'
```

#### Feature Flag Rollback
```bash
# Disable problematic features
export ANALYTICS_ENABLE_ML_ANALYSIS=false
export ANALYTICS_ENABLE_REAL_TIME_UPDATES=false

# Restart services
kubectl rollout restart deployment/analytics
```

### Extended Rollback (> 30 minutes impact)

#### Database Rollback
```bash
# If database schema changes need rollback
pg_restore -d analytics_db /path/to/backup.sql

# Or run reverse migrations
npm run migrate:down -- --steps=1
```

#### Full System Rollback
```bash
# Deploy previous version
kubectl set image deployment/analytics analytics=gcr.io/project/analytics:v0.9.0

# Wait for deployment
kubectl rollout status deployment/analytics

# Verify functionality
npm run test:smoke -- --environment=production
```
