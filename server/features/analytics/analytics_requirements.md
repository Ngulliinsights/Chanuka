# Analytics Feature Refactoring - Requirements Document

## Document Overview

This requirements document defines the specific, measurable criteria for successfully refactoring the analytics feature module. Each requirement follows the enhanced EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) pattern, beginning with a user story that establishes context and purpose, followed by structured acceptance criteria that eliminate ambiguity. The requirements are organized by architectural concern and trace directly to implementation tasks, ensuring that every aspect of the refactoring delivers verifiable value.

## Requirement Group 1: Foundation Infrastructure and Core Integration

These requirements establish the foundational utilities and integration points with existing core infrastructure that all subsequent refactoring work depends upon. Success in this group means that standardized patterns are available and proven before being applied broadly across the codebase.

### REQ-1.1: Centralized Type Definitions

**User Story:** As a developer working on analytics features, I want all domain types defined in a single, well-organized location, so that I can quickly understand the data structures I'm working with and avoid inconsistencies between different parts of the system.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

WHEN a developer needs to reference analytics domain types THEN the system SHALL provide all type definitions through a centralized types folder WHERE each subdomain (engagement, ML, financial disclosure, common) has its own type file, all types are exported through a single index file for convenient importing, no type definitions remain duplicated across multiple files, all existing type references compile successfully with the new import paths, and TypeScript strict mode validation passes without errors.

WHEN types need to evolve to support new features THEN the system SHALL require modifications in only one location per type WHERE changes propagate automatically through the type system, dependent code receives compilation errors if incompatible with type changes, the type hierarchy clearly shows relationships between base and derived types, and shared types that belong in core infrastructure are clearly identified with documentation explaining the promotion criteria.

WHEN new developers join the team THEN the system SHALL provide clear type organization WHERE the types folder structure makes it obvious which file contains which domain concepts, each type file includes JSDoc comments explaining the purpose and usage of complex types, the index file groups related types logically with section comments, and examples in the README demonstrate how to import and use common types.

WHEN integrating with core infrastructure THEN the system SHALL reuse appropriate shared types WHERE storage return types match core storage contracts, error types extend core error definitions consistently, configuration types follow core configuration patterns, and the type system prevents accidental incompatibilities between analytics and core data structures.

WHEN refactoring existing code THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility WHERE all existing code compiles with new type imports without modification to business logic, type aliases preserve any legacy naming that external code depends on, migration can happen incrementally without requiring coordinated updates across the entire codebase, and comprehensive tests verify that type changes don't alter runtime behavior.

WHEN measuring type organization quality THEN the system SHALL demonstrate improvements WHERE type duplication is reduced to zero instances across analytics services, the average time to locate a type definition decreases by at least fifty percent compared to the current scattered approach, code review feedback about type confusion or inconsistency becomes rare, and new features can reuse existing types rather than creating duplicates in at least eighty percent of cases.

### REQ-1.2: Standardized Cache Operations

**User Story:** As a developer implementing analytics features, I want a single, well-tested pattern for caching operations, so that I can add caching to new endpoints confidently without worrying about edge cases, error handling, or metric collection.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

WHEN implementing a cacheable operation THEN the system SHALL provide a getOrSetCache utility function WHERE the function accepts a cache key string, a TTL in seconds, and a computation function that returns a promise, the function automatically handles cache hits by returning the cached value without calling the computation function, cache misses trigger the computation function and store the result before returning it, and the entire operation completes in a single function call with no manual cache management code.

WHEN cache operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully WHERE cache get failures log the error but proceed to execute the computation function rather than failing the entire request, cache set failures after successful computation log the error but return the computed value since the primary operation succeeded, transient cache errors do not cause request failures that impact users, and all error conditions are logged with sufficient context to diagnose cache infrastructure issues.

WHEN monitoring cache effectiveness THEN the system SHALL collect operational metrics WHERE cache hit and miss counts are tracked per key prefix allowing analysis by data type, hit rate percentages are calculated and exported to monitoring systems, cache operation latency is measured separately from computation latency, and metrics are structured to enable alerting on sudden drops in hit rate that might indicate cache infrastructure problems.

WHEN standardizing existing cache usage THEN the system SHALL maintain exact behavior WHERE cache keys are constructed identically to preserve existing cached data, TTL values remain unchanged to avoid unexpected cache behavior changes in production, the migration from inline caching code to the utility function is purely a refactoring with no behavioral changes, and comprehensive tests verify that cache behavior remains identical before and after migration.

WHEN integrating with the existing cache infrastructure THEN the system SHALL extend rather than replace WHERE the utility function uses the existing cache client from server utils cache module, configuration for cache connection details remains centralized, the utility integrates with existing cache invalidation patterns, and operational procedures for cache management remain unchanged.

WHEN developers adopt the cache utility THEN the system SHALL reduce complexity WHERE the average lines of code for implementing caching decreases from approximately fifteen lines to three lines, error handling code is eliminated from individual cache usage sites, logging becomes consistent across all cache operations automatically, and code review feedback about caching implementation becomes focused on cache key design and TTL selection rather than error handling correctness.

### REQ-1.3: Core Error Tracking Integration

**User Story:** As an operations engineer monitoring system health, I want all analytics errors to appear in the same monitoring system as other application errors, so that I can maintain a unified view of system health and respond to issues quickly without checking multiple systems.

WHEN measuring error handling quality THEN the system SHALL demonstrate improvements WHERE the percentage of errors with complete context information increases to one hundred percent, mean time to diagnose errors decreases by at least thirty percent due to richer context, ad-hoc error logging code is eliminated completely from analytics services, and error handling patterns become consistent enough that code review feedback focuses on business logic rather than error handling correctness.

### REQ-1.4: Configuration Management Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer deploying analytics features, I want all environment-specific configuration validated at startup, so that I discover misconfigurations immediately rather than encountering errors during request handling in production.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate analytics configuration WHERE all required configuration values are checked for presence, value types are validated against expected types using Zod schemas, numeric values are validated against acceptable ranges, the application refuses to start if configuration is invalid with clear error messages indicating which values are problematic, and validation results are logged to aid in diagnosing startup failures.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL provide key metrics WHERE endpoint latency is measured and exported as histograms allowing percentile calculations, error rates are tracked per endpoint and error type, cache hit rates are measured per key prefix to understand effectiveness, database query performance is tracked separately from overall endpoint performance, and all metrics are exported to the existing monitoring infrastructure in compatible format.

WHEN metrics indicate problems THEN the system SHALL enable alerting WHERE alerts fire when error rates exceed baseline thresholds, alerts fire when latency percentiles degrade significantly, alerts fire when cache hit rates drop suddenly indicating cache infrastructure issues, alerts can be configured per endpoint for different thresholds, and alert configuration follows existing operational practices for the organization.

WHEN analyzing system behavior THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards WHERE latency percentiles are visualized over time to spot trends, error rates are broken down by type to identify root causes quickly, cache effectiveness is visualized to inform cache tuning decisions, request volume is tracked to understand load patterns, and all analytics metrics are collected in dedicated dashboards that operations teams can reference during incidents.

WHEN incidents occur THEN the system SHALL accelerate resolution WHERE monitoring data clearly shows which component is experiencing issues, trace IDs connect metrics to specific requests and logs, error context provides enough information to start investigation immediately, historical metrics help determine when the issue began, and the monitoring provides clear signal not overwhelming noise.

WHEN capacity planning THEN the system SHALL provide usage data WHERE request volume trends inform infrastructure scaling decisions, resource utilization patterns show peak usage times, growth trends indicate when capacity increases are needed, the monitoring data supports data-driven capacity planning discussions, and historical data is retained for sufficient time to identify seasonal patterns.

WHEN measuring operational readiness THEN the system SHALL demonstrate preparedness WHERE all critical endpoints have defined SLOs with monitoring and alerting, mean time to detect issues decreases by at least fifty percent due to proactive monitoring, mean time to diagnose issues decreases due to rich monitoring context, the monitoring setup follows infrastructure as code practices for reproducibility, and operations teams report high confidence in their ability to maintain the analytics system.

### REQ-5.5: Code Quality Automation and Governance

**User Story:** As a technical lead maintaining code quality, I want automated checks that enforce architectural boundaries and coding standards, so that the refactored architecture remains intact as the team continues development.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL enforce quality gates WHERE TypeScript compilation must succeed with no errors, linting rules must pass with no violations, a focused subset of unit tests must pass before commit is allowed, the pre-commit hooks execute quickly enough not to disrupt developer flow, and developers can bypass hooks temporarily when necessary but violations are caught in CI.

WHEN code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL provide guidance WHERE a code review checklist documents what reviewers should verify for each layer, layer-specific checks verify that routes are thin, controllers use the wrapper, services don't import HTTP modules, and storage methods are focused, the checklist is referenced during code review and adherence is tracked, and reviewers can focus on business logic correctness knowing that automated checks caught structural issues.

WHEN architectural boundaries are crossed THEN the system SHALL detect violations WHERE static analysis detects when services import HTTP modules, static analysis detects when routes contain business logic beyond simple orchestration, static analysis detects when storage methods contain business logic, the checks run automatically in CI and fail the build on violations, and violation reports clearly explain what rule was broken and how to fix it.

WHEN code complexity increases THEN the system SHALL flag concerns WHERE complexity metrics are tracked per file and function, thresholds trigger warnings when complexity exceeds acceptable levels, the complexity tracking helps identify candidates for refactoring before they become problematic, and trend analysis shows whether overall code complexity is improving or degrading over time.

WHEN dependencies are added THEN the system SHALL validate appropriateness WHERE new dependencies are reviewed for necessity and license compatibility, dependency updates are tracked and tested systematically, the dependency tree is monitored for security vulnerabilities, and the analytics feature maintains clear boundaries with minimal external dependencies.

WHEN measuring governance effectiveness THEN the system SHALL demonstrate impact WHERE architectural violations caught by automated checks reach zero in steady state, code review cycle time decreases because reviewers trust automated checks for structural concerns, the percentage of pull requests requiring rework decreases, technical debt accumulation slows or reverses, and the refactored architecture remains intact over months of continued development.
