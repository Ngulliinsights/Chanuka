## 🚨 **POTENTIAL INVESTOR QUESTIONS & RESPONSES**

### **Q: "How do you ensure data accuracy and prevent misinformation?"**
**A:** "Three-layer verification: (1) Automated source validation from official government APIs, (2) Expert review by credentialed constitutional lawyers and policy experts, (3) Community fact-checking with reputation scoring. Our 98.2% accuracy rate exceeds traditional media."

### **Q: "What's your competitive moat against big tech companies?"**
**A:** "Our AI workaround detection is proprietary and trained on legislative patterns that take years to develop. Plus, we're building trust through transparency - big tech has credibility issues in civic spaces. Our WCAG AAA accessibility also creates regulatory advantages."

### **Q: "How do you monetize without compromising neutrality?"**
**A:** "Revenue comes from premium features (advanced analytics, API access), not from political actors. Our business model aligns with user interests - we succeed when citizens are more engaged, not when any particular political outcome occurs."

### **Q: "What's your user acquisition strategy?"**
**A:** "Viral coefficient through civic engagement - users share bills they care about. Partnership with civic organizations, libraries, and educational institutions. SEO advantage from being the authoritative source for legislative information."

### **Q: "How do you scale beyond the initial market?"**
**A:** "State and local government expansion, then international markets. The framework works for any democratic system. We're also building API infrastructure for third-party developers to create specialized civic tools."
