/**
 * Shared Types Module
 * 
 * Central repository for type definitions used across features
 * Consolidated from client/src/types during FSD migration
 */

// Re-export all types from original location for backward compatibility during migration
export * from '../../types';

// Planned: After migration, specific type exports will be organized here
// - Analytics types (from features/analytics/model/types)
// - Common types (core domain types)
// - UI types (component prop types)
// - API types (network/REST types)
