## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### What's Working Well
1. Core feature implementation is solid
2. Schema is properly normalized
3. Database is optimized for current queries
4. Type system is consistent (with migration fixes)
5. API structure is well-organized

### What Needs Attention
1. Many declared features need implementation
2. Client UI lags behind API readiness
3. Feature documentation could be better
4. Some tables are unused (maintain vs. remove decision needed)
5. Advanced features need architecture design

### What's a Risk
1. **Schema bloat** - 160 unused tables could impact future maintenance
2. **Incomplete features** - Users may find broken features
3. **Performance at scale** - No load testing data
4. **Data validation** - Government data integration critical path
