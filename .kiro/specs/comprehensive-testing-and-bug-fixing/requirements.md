# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for comprehensive testing and validation of the Chanuka Legislative Transparency Platform to identify, document, and fix all bugs across the entire application stack. The goal is to ensure the application is production-ready with robust error handling, optimal performance, and excellent user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Test Coverage Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze current test coverage across all application components, so that I can identify gaps and ensure comprehensive testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing test coverage THEN the system SHALL generate detailed coverage reports for both server-side and client-side code
2. WHEN identifying coverage gaps THEN the system SHALL highlight untested code paths, functions, and components
3. WHEN reviewing test quality THEN the system SHALL identify tests that need improvement or additional assertions
4. WHEN analyzing test performance THEN the system SHALL identify slow or flaky tests that need optimization

### Requirement 2: Systematic Bug Detection and Documentation

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to systematically detect and document all bugs in the application, so that they can be prioritized and fixed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running automated bug detection THEN the system SHALL identify runtime errors, memory leaks, and performance issues
2. WHEN analyzing code quality THEN the system SHALL detect potential bugs through static analysis and linting
3. WHEN testing user workflows THEN the system SHALL identify UI/UX issues and accessibility problems
4. WHEN documenting bugs THEN the system SHALL create structured bug reports with reproduction steps, severity, and impact assessment

### Requirement 3: Database and API Integrity Validation

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want to validate database operations and API endpoints thoroughly, so that data integrity and API reliability are guaranteed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing database operations THEN the system SHALL validate all CRUD operations, transactions, and data consistency
2. WHEN testing API endpoints THEN the system SHALL verify request/response formats, error handling, and security measures
3. WHEN testing database schema THEN the system SHALL identify missing columns, incorrect types, and constraint violations
4. WHEN testing data migration THEN the system SHALL ensure migration scripts work correctly and data is preserved

### Requirement 4: Frontend Component and Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want comprehensive testing of all React components and their integrations, so that the user interface works flawlessly across all scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing React components THEN the system SHALL validate rendering, props handling, and state management
2. WHEN testing component interactions THEN the system SHALL verify user interactions, form submissions, and navigation
3. WHEN testing responsive design THEN the system SHALL validate layouts across different screen sizes and devices
4. WHEN testing accessibility THEN the system SHALL ensure WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation support

### Requirement 5: Performance and Security Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to validate application performance and security measures, so that the application meets production standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing performance THEN the system SHALL measure response times, memory usage, and resource utilization
2. WHEN testing security THEN the system SHALL validate authentication, authorization, and protection against common vulnerabilities
3. WHEN testing scalability THEN the system SHALL verify the application handles concurrent users and high load
4. WHEN testing error handling THEN the system SHALL ensure graceful degradation and proper error recovery

### Requirement 6: Cross-Browser and Device Compatibility

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the application to work consistently across different browsers and devices, so that I have a reliable experience regardless of my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing browser compatibility THEN the system SHALL validate functionality across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
2. WHEN testing mobile compatibility THEN the system SHALL ensure proper functionality on iOS and Android devices
3. WHEN testing responsive behavior THEN the system SHALL validate layouts and interactions across different screen sizes
4. WHEN testing progressive web app features THEN the system SHALL verify offline functionality and service worker behavior

### Requirement 7: Automated Bug Fixing and Code Quality Improvement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated tools to fix common bugs and improve code quality, so that I can focus on complex issues and feature development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying code quality issues THEN the system SHALL automatically fix formatting, linting, and simple syntax errors
2. WHEN detecting security vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL apply security patches and update dependencies
3. WHEN finding performance issues THEN the system SHALL optimize code and suggest improvements
4. WHEN discovering accessibility issues THEN the system SHALL implement fixes for common accessibility problems

### Requirement 8: Continuous Integration and Quality Gates

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want automated quality gates and continuous testing, so that bugs are caught early and code quality is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run automated tests and quality checks
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide detailed failure reports
3. WHEN quality metrics decline THEN the system SHALL alert developers and suggest corrective actions
4. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL ensure all quality gates are passed and documentation is updated
