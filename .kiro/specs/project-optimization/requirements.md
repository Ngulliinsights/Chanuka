# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the strategic optimization of the Chanuka Legislative Transparency Platform by implementing targeted improvements that balance technical debt reduction with feature enhancement. The optimization focuses on eliminating over-engineering while preserving and enhancing the platform's core legislative transparency mission.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dependency and Bundle Optimization

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want optimized application performance and reduced bundle size, so that users experience faster load times and the platform operates more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the bundle size SHALL be reduced by at least 40% from current state
2. WHEN unused dependencies are removed THEN the application SHALL maintain all existing functionality
3. WHEN UI components are audited THEN only essential Radix UI components SHALL remain imported
4. IF a component is used in fewer than 2 places THEN it SHALL be evaluated for removal or consolidation
5. WHEN the optimization is complete THEN the application SHALL load 30% faster on average

### Requirement 2: Database Query and Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want fast and reliable data access, so that I can efficiently browse bills, track legislation, and engage with content without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bill engagement stats are requested THEN they SHALL be retrieved in a single optimized query
2. WHEN frequently accessed data is requested THEN it SHALL be served from cache when appropriate
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN N+1 query patterns SHALL be eliminated
4. IF a query takes longer than 200ms THEN it SHALL be optimized or cached
5. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN response times SHALL remain under 500ms for 95% of requests

### Requirement 3: Code Quality and Technical Debt Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, maintainable code with consistent patterns, so that I can efficiently develop new features and fix issues without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN there SHALL be zero type errors or unused import warnings
2. WHEN similar functionality exists in multiple files THEN it SHALL be consolidated into reusable modules
3. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN it SHALL follow consistent patterns across all modules
4. IF duplicate route handlers exist THEN they SHALL be merged or clearly differentiated
5. WHEN code is reviewed THEN it SHALL follow established architectural patterns

### Requirement 4: API Standardization and Consistency

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent API responses and error handling, so that I can build reliable user interfaces without handling multiple response formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint is called THEN it SHALL return responses in a standardized format
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled consistently with proper HTTP status codes
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN it SHALL be enforced uniformly across protected endpoints
4. IF fallback data is used THEN it SHALL be clearly indicated in the response metadata
5. WHEN API documentation is generated THEN it SHALL accurately reflect all endpoint behaviors

### Requirement 5: Architecture Simplification

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want simplified, maintainable architecture that supports the platform's core mission, so that the system can evolve efficiently without unnecessary complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storage interfaces are used THEN they SHALL provide clear value without over-abstraction
2. WHEN similar features are implemented THEN they SHALL be consolidated into cohesive modules
3. WHEN database schema is accessed THEN unused tables and relationships SHALL be removed
4. IF abstraction layers exist THEN they SHALL solve specific problems rather than theoretical ones
5. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL follow simplified architectural patterns

### Requirement 6: Strategic Feature Enhancement

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want enhanced legislative transparency features that work reliably, so that I can effectively track and understand legislative processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bill tracking is used THEN it SHALL provide real-time updates and reliable notifications
2. WHEN sponsor analysis is accessed THEN it SHALL display comprehensive transparency data
3. WHEN user engagement is tracked THEN it SHALL provide meaningful analytics and insights
4. IF legislative data is updated THEN users SHALL be notified through appropriate channels
5. WHEN transparency features are used THEN they SHALL provide actionable information for civic engagement

### Requirement 7: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability, so that I can proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system performance degrades THEN administrators SHALL be alerted automatically
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
3. WHEN user engagement patterns change THEN analytics SHALL provide insights for improvement
4. IF database performance issues arise THEN they SHALL be detected and reported
5. WHEN optimization changes are deployed THEN their impact SHALL be measurable and tracked
