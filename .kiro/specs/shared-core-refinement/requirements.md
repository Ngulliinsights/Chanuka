# Shared Core Refinement Requirements

## Introduction

The shared/core directory has evolved organically, creating several interconnected problems that slow development and increase bug risk. This spec addresses critical architectural challenges including fragmented caching implementations, inconsistent middleware patterns, overlapping observability concerns, and scattered validation logic. The goal is to establish a clear, four-layer architecture that provides unified interfaces, explicit error handling, and seamless migration paths.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Cache System

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want a single consistent caching interface so that I can implement caching patterns without navigating multiple competing implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to implement caching THEN the system SHALL provide a unified `CacheAdapter` interface that supports get, set, delete, clear, and exists operations WHERE all cache implementations (memory, Redis, multi-tier, AI-specific) conform to this single interface contract.

2. WHEN any cache adapter initializes THEN it SHALL implement standardized lifecycle methods including initialize, healthCheck, shutdown, and getMetrics WHERE health checks return structured status information including connectivity and performance metrics.

3. WHEN cache operations encounter errors THEN the system SHALL propagate errors through the shared error management system WHERE errors include operation context, affected keys, and adapter-specific diagnostic information.

4. WHEN developers switch between cache implementations THEN the system SHALL maintain behavioral consistency through the adapter interface WHERE only configuration changes are required without modifying consuming service code.

5. WHEN multi-tier caching is configured THEN the system SHALL provide a transparent multi-tier adapter WHERE read operations check tiers sequentially and write operations propagate to all configured tiers automatically.

### Requirement 2: Centralized Cache Factory

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want centralized cache instantiation through a single factory so that cache creation is consistent, testable, and properly integrated with observability systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes caching subsystems THEN the system SHALL provide a `CacheFactory` that creates instances based on validated configuration WHERE factory methods reject invalid configurations with descriptive error messages before instantiation.

2. WHEN cache instances are created THEN the factory SHALL automatically register them with the observability system WHERE all cache operations emit structured logs and metrics without requiring manual instrumentation.

3. WHEN application shutdown occurs THEN the factory SHALL maintain a registry of active cache instances WHERE coordinated cleanup operations ensure graceful shutdown across all registered caches.

### Requirement 3: Consolidated Middleware Factory

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want a unified middleware factory that replaces scattered creation patterns so that middleware integration follows predictable, testable patterns across all routes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN middleware needs creation THEN the system SHALL provide a single `MiddlewareFactory` consolidating functionality from factory.ts, enhanced-factory.ts, and unified.ts WHERE all existing middleware creation patterns are supported through the unified interface.

2. WHEN middleware registers with the factory THEN the system SHALL validate required configuration and dependencies WHERE validation failures produce actionable error messages identifying missing or invalid configuration.

3. WHEN middleware requires shared services THEN the factory SHALL provide dependency injection WHERE logging, metrics, caching, and configuration services are available through a consistent service container.

### Requirement 4: Unified Observability Stack

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want all observability signals coordinated through a single initialization point so that logging, metrics, tracing, and health checks work cohesively with shared context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL provide an `ObservabilityStack` class coordinating all observability components WHERE logging, metrics, tracing, and health check systems are configured together with shared context.

2. WHEN observability systems activate THEN correlation IDs SHALL generate automatically and propagate across all signals WHERE logs, metrics, and traces can be correlated for any request throughout its lifecycle.

3. WHEN components emit metrics THEN the system SHALL enforce standardized metric naming following the pattern {service}.{component}.{metric_name} WHERE metric names are consistent across all services and environments.

### Requirement 5: Centralized Schema Management

**User Story:** As a full-stack developer, I want all validation schemas centralized in a clear structure so that I can easily find, reuse, and maintain validation logic across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation schemas are defined THEN they SHALL reside in shared/core/src/validation/schemas/ WHERE schemas are organized by domain such as auth, common, property, and bill with clear separation of concerns.

2. WHEN developers implement validation THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation on when to use Zod, Joi, or custom validators WHERE guidance explains the appropriate use cases, performance characteristics, and type safety benefits of each approach.

3. WHEN validation operations fail THEN errors SHALL follow a consistent structure WHERE field names, error messages, validation rule identifiers, and error codes are predictable across all validator implementations.

### Requirement 6: Unified Error Hierarchy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all application errors to extend from a common base class so that error handling, logging, and recovery strategies are consistent throughout the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors are created THEN they SHALL extend from `BaseError` in shared/core/src/primitives/errors/ WHERE all errors include HTTP status code, application error code, human-readable message, and structured metadata.

2. WHEN errors are thrown THEN they SHALL automatically integrate with the observability system WHERE errors are logged with appropriate severity, full context, and correlation IDs without manual instrumentation.

3. WHEN errors propagate through middleware and service layers THEN correlation IDs SHALL be maintained WHERE errors can be traced back to their originating request across all system boundaries.

### Requirement 7: Incremental Migration Support

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to migrate to the refined shared/core incrementally so that we deliver value continuously without risking a large, coordinated release.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN legacy implementations exist THEN the system SHALL provide adapter bridges in legacy-adapters directories WHERE old interfaces delegate internally to new implementations ensuring backward compatibility.

2. WHEN both old and new implementations coexist THEN the system SHALL support feature flags WHERE teams can toggle between implementations at the service level or per-route level for controlled rollout.

3. WHEN migration is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide validation tools WHERE teams can compare outputs from old and new implementations to verify behavioral equivalence.

### Requirement 8: Breaking Change Management

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want breaking changes to follow a structured deprecation cycle so that consuming services have adequate time to adapt without service disruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN breaking changes are introduced THEN deprecated functionality SHALL remain available for at least one major version WHERE consuming services have sufficient time to plan and execute migrations.

2. WHEN deprecated code executes THEN structured warnings SHALL be emitted to logs WHERE teams can identify usage of deprecated APIs, the calling code location, and recommended alternatives.

3. WHEN deprecation timelines are established THEN sunset dates SHALL be clearly communicated through documentation, logs, and release notes WHERE teams know exactly when deprecated code will be removed.

## Success Metrics

These requirements are successfully met when:

- Code duplication within shared/core is reduced by at least 50% as measured by static analysis tools
- Developer velocity increases, demonstrated by reduced time to implement features using shared core components
- System reliability improves with measurably fewer bugs originating from shared core
- Onboarding time for new developers decreases by at least 30% as architecture becomes more intuitive
- Test coverage for shared/core reaches 90% with comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Performance benchmarks show no regression, with cache hit rates maintaining or exceeding 90%
