# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for systematically identifying and fixing all errors in the Chanuka Legislative Transparency Platform codebase. The goal is to achieve a fully functional, error-free application by addressing issues in a structured manner: frontend first, then shared components, and finally backend components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all frontend build and runtime errors resolved, so that the client application builds successfully and runs without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the frontend THEN the system SHALL complete without build errors
2. WHEN analyzing frontend imports THEN the system SHALL resolve all import path issues
3. WHEN checking TypeScript compilation THEN the system SHALL have zero TypeScript errors
4. WHEN running frontend tests THEN all tests SHALL pass without failures
5. WHEN loading the application THEN the system SHALL render without runtime errors

### Requirement 2: Shared Components Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all shared component errors resolved, so that both frontend and backend can properly utilize shared functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building shared components THEN the system SHALL compile without errors
2. WHEN importing shared modules THEN the system SHALL resolve all dependencies correctly
3. WHEN running shared component tests THEN all tests SHALL pass
4. WHEN using shared utilities THEN the system SHALL function without runtime errors
5. WHEN validating shared schemas THEN the system SHALL have consistent type definitions

### Requirement 3: Backend Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all backend errors resolved, so that the server runs reliably and all API endpoints function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the backend server THEN the system SHALL start without errors
2. WHEN connecting to the database THEN the system SHALL establish connections successfully
3. WHEN running backend tests THEN all tests SHALL pass
4. WHEN making API requests THEN all endpoints SHALL respond correctly
5. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL handle all operations without errors

### Requirement 4: Import Path and Module Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all import paths and module resolutions fixed, so that the build system can properly resolve all dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing import statements THEN the system SHALL resolve all relative and absolute paths
2. WHEN checking module dependencies THEN the system SHALL find all referenced files
3. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL not encounter module resolution errors
4. WHEN using path aliases THEN the system SHALL resolve them correctly
5. WHEN importing from shared modules THEN the system SHALL locate all exports

### Requirement 5: TypeScript Compilation Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript compilation errors resolved, so that the codebase maintains type safety and builds successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running TypeScript compiler THEN the system SHALL report zero errors
2. WHEN checking type definitions THEN the system SHALL have consistent interfaces
3. WHEN using generic types THEN the system SHALL infer types correctly
4. WHEN importing types THEN the system SHALL resolve all type dependencies
5. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL generate valid JavaScript

### Requirement 6: Test Configuration and Execution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test configurations fixed and tests passing, so that the codebase has reliable test coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN all tests SHALL execute and pass
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN all tests SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN running end-to-end tests THEN all user workflows SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN checking test coverage THEN the system SHALL meet minimum coverage thresholds
5. WHEN executing test suites THEN the system SHALL use correct test configurations

### Requirement 7: Database and API Integrity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all database and API errors resolved, so that data operations and API endpoints function reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to the database THEN the system SHALL establish connections without errors
2. WHEN running database migrations THEN all migrations SHALL execute successfully
3. WHEN making API calls THEN all endpoints SHALL respond with correct data
4. WHEN validating data schemas THEN the system SHALL enforce all constraints
5. WHEN handling database transactions THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity

### Requirement 8: Build System and Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all build system errors resolved, so that the application can be built and deployed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the build process THEN the system SHALL complete without errors
2. WHEN bundling assets THEN the system SHALL generate optimized bundles
3. WHEN processing configuration files THEN the system SHALL parse all settings correctly
4. WHEN generating production builds THEN the system SHALL create deployable artifacts
5. WHEN validating build outputs THEN the system SHALL meet all quality requirements

### Requirement 9: Error Tracking and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error tracking during the fixing process, so that I can monitor progress and ensure no errors are missed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN detecting errors THEN the system SHALL categorize them by type and severity
2. WHEN fixing errors THEN the system SHALL track resolution status
3. WHEN validating fixes THEN the system SHALL verify error resolution
4. WHEN completing fixes THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports
5. WHEN monitoring progress THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates

### Requirement 10: Automated Error Detection and Prevention

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated tools to detect and prevent future errors, so that the codebase maintains high quality over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN committing code THEN the system SHALL run automated error checks
2. WHEN detecting potential issues THEN the system SHALL provide fix suggestions
3. WHEN preventing regressions THEN the system SHALL block problematic changes
4. WHEN maintaining code quality THEN the system SHALL enforce coding standards
5. WHEN deploying changes THEN the system SHALL validate error-free operation
