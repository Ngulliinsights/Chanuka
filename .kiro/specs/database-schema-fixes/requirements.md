# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Chanuka Platform is experiencing database schema inconsistencies that are causing the security monitoring service to fail during compliance checks. The primary issue is a missing `next_check` column in the `compliance_checks` table, which is preventing the system from properly scheduling and tracking compliance monitoring tasks. This feature addresses these database schema issues to ensure the security monitoring system functions correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the compliance checking system to function without database errors, so that security monitoring can operate reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the security monitoring service initializes THEN the compliance_checks table SHALL have all required columns including next_check
2. WHEN compliance checks are scheduled THEN the system SHALL successfully insert records without column errors
3. WHEN the application starts THEN all database schema validation SHALL pass without errors
4. WHEN compliance checks run THEN the system SHALL properly track next check scheduling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper database migration scripts for schema fixes, so that database changes can be applied consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration scripts are executed THEN the compliance_checks table SHALL be updated with missing columns
2. WHEN migrations run THEN existing data SHALL be preserved and remain functional
3. WHEN rollback is needed THEN migration scripts SHALL provide proper rollback procedures
4. WHEN schema changes are applied THEN the system SHALL validate schema integrity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the security monitoring service to initialize successfully, so that compliance checks can be performed automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the security monitoring service SHALL initialize without errors
2. WHEN compliance checks are scheduled THEN the system SHALL store scheduling information correctly
3. WHEN compliance rules are evaluated THEN the system SHALL track completion and next check times
4. WHEN the service runs THEN all compliance check types SHALL execute successfully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive compliance tracking, so that I can monitor system compliance status over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compliance checks complete THEN the system SHALL record check results and timestamps
2. WHEN scheduling next checks THEN the system SHALL calculate and store appropriate next check times
3. WHEN viewing compliance status THEN the system SHALL display current and historical compliance data
4. WHEN compliance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL properly log and alert on violations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want schema validation and health checks, so that database integrity issues can be detected early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required database tables and columns exist
2. WHEN schema issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and remediation steps
3. WHEN database health checks run THEN the system SHALL verify table structure integrity
4. WHEN schema migrations are needed THEN the system SHALL identify and report missing or incorrect schema elements
