# Design Document

## Overview

This design addresses critical navigation issues in the Chanuka Legislative Transparency Platform by implementing a robust responsive navigation system and fixing non-functional homepage links. The solution focuses on creating a seamless user experience across all device types while maintaining the platform's legislative transparency mission.

## Architecture

### Navigation System Architecture

The navigation system will be restructured around three core components:

1. **Responsive Layout Manager**: Handles device detection and navigation mode switching
2. **Unified Navigation State**: Centralized state management for navigation across components
3. **Link Resolution System**: Ensures all navigation links are properly functional

### Component Hierarchy

```
AppLayout
├── ResponsiveNavigationProvider
│   ├── DesktopSidebar (desktop/tablet)
│   ├── MobileNavigation (mobile)
│   └── NavigationStateManager
└── MainContent
```

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. ResponsiveNavigationProvider

**Purpose**: Manages responsive behavior and navigation state across the application.

**Key Features**:
- Device detection using proper media queries
- Hydration-safe rendering to prevent layout shifts
- Persistent sidebar state management
- Smooth transitions between navigation modes

**Interface**:
```typescript
interface NavigationContextType {
  isMobile: boolean;
  sidebarCollapsed: boolean;
  toggleSidebar: () => void;
  isActive: (path: string) => boolean;
  mounted: boolean;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced DesktopSidebar

**Purpose**: Provides responsive desktop navigation with proper state management.

**Key Features**:
- Collapsible sidebar with persistent state
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Proper active state highlighting
- Accessibility support

**Responsive Behavior**:
- Visible on screens ≥ 768px
- Collapsible with toggle button
- State persisted in localStorage
- Smooth width transitions

### 3. Enhanced MobileNavigation

**Purpose**: Provides intuitive mobile navigation experience.

**Key Features**:
- Bottom navigation bar for mobile devices
- Touch-friendly interface
- Essential navigation items
- Proper active state indication

**Responsive Behavior**:
- Visible on screens < 768px
- Fixed bottom positioning
- Touch-optimized sizing
- Swipe-friendly interactions

### 4. LinkResolver Component

**Purpose**: Ensures all navigation links are properly functional and accessible.

**Key Features**:
- Validates all navigation links
- Provides consistent link behavior
- Handles authentication-based routing
- Implements proper focus management

## Data Models

### Navigation State Model

```typescript
interface NavigationState {
  currentPath: string;
  sidebarCollapsed: boolean;
  isMobile: boolean;
  mounted: boolean;
  activeSection: string;
}

interface NavigationItem {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  path: string;
  icon: React.ComponentType;
  requiresAuth?: boolean;
  adminOnly?: boolean;
  mobileVisible?: boolean;
}
```

### Responsive Breakpoints

```typescript
const BREAKPOINTS = {
  mobile: '(max-width: 767px)',
  tablet: '(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px)',
  desktop: '(min-width: 1024px)'
} as const;
```

## Error Handling

### Hydration Mismatch Prevention

- Implement `mounted` state to prevent server/client rendering mismatches
- Use `useEffect` to initialize responsive behavior only on client side
- Provide fallback states during hydration

### Link Resolution Errors

- Validate all navigation paths during build
- Implement fallback navigation for broken links
- Log navigation errors for debugging

### Responsive Behavior Errors

- Handle media query failures gracefully
- Provide fallback navigation modes
- Ensure navigation remains functional during resize events

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

1. **Navigation State Management**
   - Test sidebar toggle functionality
   - Verify state persistence across sessions
   - Test responsive breakpoint detection

2. **Link Functionality**
   - Test all homepage links navigate correctly
   - Verify active state highlighting
   - Test authentication-based routing

3. **Responsive Behavior**
   - Test navigation mode switching
   - Verify layout stability during resize
   - Test touch interactions on mobile

### Integration Tests

1. **Cross-Device Navigation**
   - Test navigation consistency across devices
   - Verify state synchronization
   - Test responsive transitions

2. **User Journey Tests**
   - Test complete navigation flows
   - Verify accessibility compliance
   - Test keyboard navigation

### Performance Tests

1. **Rendering Performance**
   - Measure navigation rendering times
   - Test smooth transition animations
   - Verify no layout shifts during hydration

2. **State Management Performance**
   - Test state update efficiency
   - Verify localStorage operations
   - Test memory usage during navigation

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Implement ResponsiveNavigationProvider
- Fix media query hook for proper SSR handling
- Create unified navigation state management

### Phase 2: Desktop Navigation
- Enhance DesktopSidebar with proper responsive behavior
- Implement persistent sidebar state
- Add smooth animations and transitions

### Phase 3: Mobile Navigation
- Enhance MobileNavigation component
- Implement touch-friendly interactions
- Add essential navigation items

### Phase 4: Link Resolution
- Fix all homepage navigation links
- Implement proper active state management
- Add link validation and error handling

### Phase 5: Testing and Optimization
- Implement comprehensive test suite
- Optimize performance and animations

## Technical Considerations

### SSR Compatibility
- All responsive behavior must be hydration-safe
- Use `mounted` state to prevent layout shifts
- Implement proper fallback states

### Performance Optimization
- Minimize re-renders during responsive changes
- Use CSS transitions for smooth animations
- Implement efficient state management

### Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- Implement proper ARIA labels
- Provide screen reader support

### Browser Compatibility
- Support modern browsers with media query API
- Provide fallbacks for older browsers
