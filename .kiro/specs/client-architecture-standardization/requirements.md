# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to comprehensively standardize the client-side architecture by implementing consistent patterns across all components, following the well-established navigation component as the gold standard. The standardization will improve code maintainability, type safety, error handling, testing coverage, and overall developer experience while ensuring consistent patterns throughout the codebase.

The approach will be thorough and ambitious, leveraging AI capabilities to handle complex refactoring and standardization across the entire client folder structure, including deduplication, UI/UX enhancements, and cross-layer architectural alignment.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling patterns across all components, so that errors are handled predictably and users receive appropriate feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in any component THEN the system SHALL use the navigation component's error handling pattern
2. WHEN implementing error boundaries THEN the system SHALL provide fallback UI components with recovery options
3. WHEN creating custom error classes THEN the system SHALL extend the standardized error types
4. IF an error has recovery mechanisms THEN the system SHALL provide both automatic and manual recovery strategies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage with consistent patterns, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests for components THEN the system SHALL follow the navigation component's testing patterns
2. WHEN creating test files THEN the system SHALL implement both unit and integration tests with consistent naming

4. IF a component has complex logic THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive test coverage with edge cases
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent test structure and assertions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized configuration management, so that complex configurations are documented and validated consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting complex configurations THEN the system SHALL use markdown-based documentation like navigation
2. WHEN implementing runtime configuration THEN the system SHALL provide validation with clear error messages
3. WHEN managing component configurations THEN the system SHALL centralize configuration management
4. IF configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate changes against defined schemas
5. WHEN accessing configuration THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe configuration interfaces

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent component architecture patterns, so that components are built with predictable structure and behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating custom hooks THEN the system SHALL follow standardized hook patterns with proper error handling
2. WHEN implementing data fetching THEN the system SHALL use consistent patterns with loading and error states
3. WHEN composing components THEN the system SHALL follow established composition patterns
4. IF components share functionality THEN the system SHALL extract shared logic into reusable utilities
5. WHEN building UI components THEN the system SHALL implement consistent component interfaces

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent styling patterns across components, so that the UI has a cohesive look and maintainable CSS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying CSS classes THEN the system SHALL use standardized naming conventions
2. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL follow consistent component styling patterns
3. WHEN creating design system components THEN the system SHALL implement reusable design tokens
4. IF styling conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution strategies
5. WHEN maintaining styles THEN the system SHALL ensure CSS organization follows component structure

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate redundant functionalities across all client components, so that the codebase is maintainable and doesn't have duplicate implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing component functionality THEN the system SHALL identify and catalog all overlapping features across the entire client folder
2. WHEN finding duplicate implementations THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into shared utilities or components
3. WHEN removing redundant code THEN the system SHALL ensure all dependent components are updated to use the consolidated version
4. IF multiple components provide similar functionality THEN the system SHALL create a unified interface that serves all use cases
5. WHEN refactoring overlapping features THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility during the transition period

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user and developer, I want the client interface to be aesthetically beautiful, intuitive to navigate, and visually consistent, so that the application provides an excellent user experience and maintains design coherence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing UI components THEN the system SHALL follow established design principles with consistent visual hierarchy, spacing, and typography
2. WHEN creating user interfaces THEN the system SHALL ensure accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
3. WHEN implementing navigation THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive user flows with clear visual feedback and state indicators
4. IF users interact with forms or data entry THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation feedback and helpful error messages
5. WHEN displaying information THEN the system SHALL use consistent data visualization patterns and responsive design principles

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the client folder structure and patterns to be congruent with backend/server and shared folders, so that the entire codebase maintains architectural consistency and developers can easily navigate between layers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing client components THEN the system SHALL mirror the architectural patterns used in server and shared folders
2. WHEN creating client utilities THEN the system SHALL follow the same naming conventions and organizational structure as server utilities
