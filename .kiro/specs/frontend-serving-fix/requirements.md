# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Chanuka Legislative Transparency Platform is experiencing critical issues where the frontend is not being served properly and is not functioning correctly when accessed. Users cannot interact with the application, pages fail to load, and the React application may not be initializing properly. This feature addresses the fundamental serving and functionality problems to ensure users can access and use the platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Frontend Asset Serving

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend application to load properly when I visit the platform, so that I can access all features and functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the root URL THEN the system SHALL serve the React application successfully
2. WHEN the HTML page loads THEN all CSS and JavaScript assets SHALL be loaded without 404 errors
3. WHEN Vite development server is running THEN it SHALL properly integrate with the Express server
4. WHEN static assets are requested THEN they SHALL be served with correct MIME types and headers
5. IF asset loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages in the browser console

### Requirement 2: React Application Initialization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the React application to initialize and render correctly, so that I can see the user interface and navigate the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the React application SHALL mount to the root DOM element successfully
2. WHEN React initializes THEN all core components SHALL render without JavaScript errors
3. WHEN the router loads THEN navigation SHALL work correctly between different pages
4. WHEN lazy-loaded components are accessed THEN they SHALL load and render properly
5. IF React initialization fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message

### Requirement 3: API Integration Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend to communicate properly with the backend API, so that I can view data and perform actions on the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API requests THEN they SHALL reach the backend endpoints successfully
2. WHEN API responses are received THEN they SHALL be processed and displayed correctly in the UI
3. WHEN CORS is configured THEN cross-origin requests SHALL be allowed appropriately
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN API requests SHALL include proper authorization headers
5. IF API requests fail THEN the frontend SHALL handle errors gracefully with user feedback

### Requirement 4: Development Server Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the development server to work correctly, so that I can develop and test the application locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running npm run dev THEN both frontend and backend SHALL start without errors
2. WHEN Vite HMR is active THEN code changes SHALL be reflected immediately in the browser
3. WHEN the development server starts THEN it SHALL proxy API requests to the backend correctly
4. WHEN accessing the application in development THEN all features SHALL work as expected
5. IF the development server encounters errors THEN they SHALL be clearly displayed in the console

### Requirement 5: Production Build Functionality

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the production build to work correctly, so that the application can be deployed and accessed by users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the build command THEN all frontend assets SHALL be compiled successfully
2. WHEN the production server starts THEN it SHALL serve the built frontend application
3. WHEN users access the production application THEN all functionality SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN static files are served THEN they SHALL be optimized and cached appropriately
5. IF the production build fails THEN clear error messages SHALL indicate the cause

### Requirement 6: Browser Compatibility and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user on any modern browser, I want the application to work correctly, so that I can access the platform regardless of my browser choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge THEN the application SHALL function correctly
2. WHEN JavaScript errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught and handled gracefully
3. WHEN network requests fail THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed to users
4. WHEN the browser console is checked THEN there SHALL be no critical errors preventing functionality
5. IF browser compatibility issues arise THEN fallback solutions SHALL be provided

### Requirement 7: Asset Loading and Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load quickly and efficiently, so that I can start using the platform without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN critical CSS SHALL be loaded first to prevent layout shifts
2. WHEN JavaScript bundles load THEN they SHALL be optimized for fast parsing and execution
3. WHEN images and other assets load THEN they SHALL not block the initial page render
4. WHEN the application is cached THEN subsequent visits SHALL load faster
5. IF loading takes too long THEN loading indicators SHALL inform users of progress

### Requirement 8: Mobile and Responsive Functionality

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the application to work correctly on my device, so that I can access legislative information on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing on mobile devices THEN the application SHALL render and function properly
2. WHEN the viewport changes THEN the layout SHALL adapt responsively
3. WHEN touch interactions are used THEN they SHALL work correctly for navigation and actions
4. WHEN mobile browsers load the app THEN all features SHALL remain accessible
5. IF mobile-specific issues occur THEN they SHALL be handled with appropriate fallbacks
