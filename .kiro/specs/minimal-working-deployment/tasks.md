  - Add loading states and error handling for bill data fetching
  - Integrate with fallback data when database is unavailable
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Implement comment system for community input

  - Create comment display component for bill detail pages
  - Add comment submission form for authenticated users
  - Implement comment API endpoints (GET/POST /api/bills/:id/comments)

  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 7. Build authentication UI components

  - Create login form component with validation
  - Build registration form component with user feedback
  - Add authentication state management throughout the app
  - Implement protected route wrapper for authenticated-only pages
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 8. Configure production build system

  - Fix Vite build configuration to handle all imports correctly
  - Set up environment variable handling for production deployment
  - Configure Express to serve built React app in production mode
  - Add build optimization settings for smaller bundle sizes
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 9. Implement comprehensive error handling

  - Configure asset compression and caching for production
  - _Requirements: 6.4_

- [ ] 11. Create deployment configuration

  - Set up Docker configuration for containerized deployment
  - Create environment variable template with all required settings
  - Add startup scripts that handle database migration and fallback setup
  - Configure production server settings (port binding, static file serving)
  - _Requirements: 6.2, 6.3_

- [x] 12. Test and validate complete application

  - Test application startup in both development and production modes
  - Verify all core user flows work end-to-end (view bills, register, login, comment)
