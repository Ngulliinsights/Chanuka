# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Chanuka Legislative Transparency Platform currently has complex dependencies and import path issues that prevent it from running in development or production.

3. WHEN users view comments THEN they SHALL see author information and timestamps
4. WHEN no database is available THEN comments SHALL be stored in memory for the session

### Requirement 6: Production-Ready Build System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to build and deploy the application to production, so that users can access the platform.

2. WHEN the production build runs THEN it SHALL serve static files efficiently
3. WHEN deployed THEN the application SHALL handle environment variables properly
4. WHEN in production THEN appropriate security headers and optimizations SHALL be applied

### Requirement 7: Database Fallback System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to work without a database connection, so that deployment is simplified and the app remains functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN database reconnects THEN the system SHALL seamlessly switch back
4. WHEN in fallback mode THEN users SHALL be notified of limited functionality

### Requirement 8: Essential API Endpoints
