# **Constitutional Normalization and the Crisis of Institutional Integrity in Kenya: A Judicial and Legislative Audit (2010–2025)**

## **1\. Introduction: The Unfinished Business of Transformative Constitutionalism**

The promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya in 2010 was universally heralded as a watershed moment in the nation's political and legal history. It was not merely a change of supreme law but a fundamental reordering of the social contract, intended to transition the Kenyan state from a "culture of authority"—characterized by an imperial presidency, a subservient legislature, and a timid judiciary—to a "culture of justification." In this new dispensation, every exercise of public power was expected to be justified on the basis of legality, rationality, and the public interest.1 The 2010 text was designed as a "transformative charter," aiming to heal the wounds of the post-election violence of 2007/2008 and to dismantle the structures of state capture that had defined the post-colonial era.

However, a forensic audit of the decade and a half following this promulgation reveals a complex and often contradictory trajectory. While the text of the Constitution remains robust, the political and institutional practice has drifted towards what scholars and legal analysts describe as "constitutional normalization" or, more ominously, "constitutional retrogression".3 Constitutional normalization refers to the gradual process by which the radical/transformative potential of a new constitution is tamed, eroded, or co-opted by the existing political elite, adapting the new rules to fit old pathologies.3 Retrogression, a sharper concept, implies a deliberate slide back towards authoritarianism or lawlessness through the very mechanisms of democracy.5

This report provides an exhaustive analysis of this phenomenon, anchored in three critical arenas of contestation that have defined the Kenyan public sphere between 2013 and 2025:

1. **The Battle for the Purse:** The persistent legislative attempts to undermine the separation of powers through the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) and its successors, against the backdrop of devolution.  
2. **The Constituent Power:** The jurisprudential war over the "Basic Structure Doctrine" during the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) process, which tested the limits of executive power in amending the Constitution.  
3. **Legislative Capture and Oversight Failure:** The inability of Parliament to check grand corruption, manifested in the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) procurement, the Contraband Sugar scandal, and the regulation of the Betting industry.

Through a detailed examination of case law, parliamentary reports, and academic commentary, this report argues that while the Judiciary has largely held the line against the most egregious assaults on the Constitution (such as the BBI), the Legislature has largely abdicated its oversight role, succumbing to state capture and engaging in "abusive constitutionalism"—the use of legal tools to subvert the democratic order.7

**2\. The Fiscal Constitution: Devolution, Separation of Powers, and the CDF Saga**

The litigation history of the Constituencies Development Fund (CDF), later rebranded as the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF), serves as the primary longitudinal case study of the legislature's resistance to the separation of powers mandated by the 2010 Constitution. The CDF, originally established in 2003, was a popular mechanism for decentralizing development. However, the 2010 Constitution introduced a strict separation of powers and a two-tier system of government (National and County), which fundamentally rendered the MP-controlled model untenable.

### **2.1 The Constitutional Infirmity of the CDF Act 2013**

The first major confrontation arose with the enactment of the *CDF Act 2013*. Civil society organizations, led by the Institute for Social Accountability (TISA), challenged the Act, arguing that it violated the principles of devolution and separation of powers.8 The core of the argument was structural: under the 2010 Constitution, the role of a Member of Parliament (MP) is strictly limited to representation, legislation, and oversight. The Executive (at national and county levels) is charged with implementation.

The High Court declared the *CDF Act 2013* unconstitutional, a decision that was later affirmed by the Supreme Court. The Courts found that by allowing MPs to control project identification and funding, the Act conflated the roles of the legislature and the executive.9 If an MP sits on the committee that allocates funds and oversees the implementation of projects, they cannot objectively perform their constitutional duty of oversight. They essentially become the "implementer" and the "auditor" simultaneously, creating a structural conflict of interest that defeats the checks and balances envisioned in the Constitution.10

Furthermore, the Courts found that the CDF encroached on the functional integrity of County Governments. Many of the projects funded by CDF—such as local health facilities and water projects—are functions fully devolved to counties under the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution. By retaining these funds at the constituency level under the guise of the "National Government," the legislature was effectively creating a third tier of government not contemplated by the Constitution.8

### **2.2 The "Mootness" Defense and the NG-CDF Act 2015**

Following the High Court's initial declaration of unconstitutionality, the legislature engaged in a tactic often described as "constitutional avoidance" or "legislative laundering." Rather than complying with the substance of the judgment, Parliament repealed the 2013 Act and replaced it with the *National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF) Act 2015*.

During the Supreme Court appeal regarding the 2013 Act, the Attorney General and Parliament argued that the case was "moot" because the offending 2013 legislation had been repealed and replaced by the 2015 Act. They submitted that the application of the CDF Act 2013 had ceased by operation of law and that the Court should not expend resources on a dead statute.9

The Supreme Court, however, rejected this "mootness" defense in a landmark ruling on the jurisdiction and justiciability of such disputes. Relying on the United States Supreme Court decision in *Chafin v. Chafin* (133 S. Ct. 1017, 2013), the Kenyan Supreme Court held that a case is not moot as long as a party continues to suffer an injury for which the court can award a remedy. The Court noted that the "primary relief" might have been mooted by the repeal, but the "injustice" and the contravention of the doctrine of separation of powers remained alive.9 The 1st Respondent (TISA) successfully argued that the NG-CDF Act 2015 did not fundamentally alter the unconstitutional structure of the fund; it merely rebranded it while retaining the MP's central role in the administration of public funds, thereby continuing the violation of the separation of powers.9

### **2.3 The Cycle of Re-enactment and "Constitutional Normalization"**

The saga did not end with the Supreme Court's pronouncement. The political class, determined to retain control over the patronage resources afforded by the fund, continued to allocate billions to the NG-CDF annually. This persistence is a manifestation of "constitutional normalization," where elites seek to normalize unconstitutional practices through repetition and political consensus, effectively daring the judiciary to intervene repeatedly.3

In September 2024, the High Court once again declared the *NG-CDF Act 2015* unconstitutional. The three-judge bench held that despite the cosmetic amendments made in 2022 and 2023 to align the fund with "national government functions," the fund still violated the principle of devolution. The Court noted that the fund continued to finance projects that fall under the functions of county governments, causing a duplication of roles and wastage of public resources.7

This persistent litigation reveals a deeper "culture of defiance" within the legislature. Rather than accepting the constitutional reality that service delivery is an executive function (devolved or national), MPs have consistently legislated to retain executive power. This phenomenon aligns with the observations of scholars who note that post-colonial African elites often seek to "dilute and dissolve all restraints on power" through facially legal changes.11

### **2.4 The 2025 Entrenchment Bill: Abusive Constitutionalism?**

Faced with repeated judicial defeats, the legislature initiated a new strategy in 2024/2025: constitutional amendment. The *Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2025* seeks to formally entrench the NG-CDF, the National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF), and a new Senate Oversight Fund (SOF) directly into the Constitution.7

This move represents a textbook case of "abusive constitutionalism"—the use of constitutional amendment mechanisms to undermine the core democratic principles of the constitution itself.7 By embedding these funds in the Constitution, MPs aim to insulate them from judicial review on the grounds of unconstitutionality. If the funds are part of the Constitution, they cannot be "unconstitutional."

However, critics and civil society organizations argue that this amendment would amount to a "constitutional dismemberment" or "evisceration".12 It would fundamentally alter the basic structure of the Constitution regarding the separation of powers and the structure of devolution. The Bill has been criticized for:

1. **Undermining Devolution:** It permanently diverts revenue that should go to County Governments or the National Executive to the direct control of the Legislature.  
2. **Breaching Separation of Powers:** It constitutionalizes the conflict of interest where legislators are also implementers of the budget.7  
3. **Override of Judiciary:** It is a direct legislative veto of binding court decisions, signaling a breakdown in the comity between branches of government.

The table below summarizes the legislative and judicial ping-pong regarding these funds:

| Legal Instrument | Status | Key Judicial/Legislative Finding |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **CDF Act 2013** | **Unconstitutional** | Violated separation of powers; MPs performing executive functions; encroached on County functions.8 |
| **NG-CDF Act 2015** | **Unconstitutional** | High Court (Sept 2024\) ruled it continues to violate devolution principles; duplicative of county roles.7 |
| **NGAAF** | **Contested** | Criticized for similar breaches of separation of powers; MPs controlling affirmative action funds.7 |
| **Senate Oversight Fund** | **Proposed** | New fund in the 2025 Bill; critics argue Senators cannot oversee funds they administer.7 |
| **Amendment Bill 2025** | **Process Ongoing** | Attempt to "entrench" funds to bypass judicial review; described as abusive constitutionalism.7 |

**3\. The Constituent Power: The Basic Structure Doctrine and the BBI Judgment**

If the CDF saga represents the struggle over the "fiscal constitution," the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) case represented the battle for the "soul" of the Constitution itself. The case, *David Ndii & Others v. Attorney General & Others*, dealt with the limits of the power to amend the Constitution and introduced the "Basic Structure Doctrine" to the Kenyan legal landscape.

### **3.1 The Context: The Handshake and the Omnibus Bill**

The BBI emerged from the "Handshake" between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition Leader Raila Odinga following the disputed 2017 election. While framed as a peace-building initiative, the BBI culminated in the *Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020*, an omnibus bill proposing 74 amendments. These included the creation of a Prime Minister post, the expansion of Parliament, and the creation of an Office of the Judiciary Ombudsman.14

The Bill was processed via the "Popular Initiative" route under Article 257 of the Constitution. This route allows amendments to be initiated by a petition signed by at least one million registered voters. The state argued that the BBI was a popular initiative supported by the people. The petitioners, however, argued that it was a state-driven project initiated by the President, disguised as a popular initiative to bypass the more rigorous parliamentary safeguards required for state-sponsored amendments under Article 256\.14

### **3.2 The High Court and Court of Appeal: The "Instant Classic"**

The High Court, and subsequently the Court of Appeal, delivered judgments that have been described globally as "instant classics" of transformative constitutionalism.16 The Courts held that the **Basic Structure Doctrine** applies in Kenya. This doctrine, originating from the Indian Supreme Court case *Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala*, posits that certain core features of a constitution (its "basic structure") are so fundamental that they cannot be altered or destroyed through the ordinary amendment process.

Justice Kiage of the Court of Appeal provided a stinging historical critique of the Kenyan political elite's relationship with constitutionalism. He located the "core pathology" of post-colonial African governance in the excessive centralization of power within the Presidency. He argued that historically, elites have used facially legal amendments to "dilute and dissolve all restraints on power," leading to the "obliteration of checks and balances".11

The Courts engaged in a "holistic reading" of the Constitution, focusing on its history (the struggle against authoritarianism) and its Preamble.18 They concluded that the "primary constituent power" belongs to the people. While the "secondary constituent power" (amendment power) allows for changes, it does not allow for the *replacement* or *destruction* of the Constitution's identity. The BBI, by fundamentally altering the structure of the Executive and Judiciary, was deemed to be an exercise in "dis-memberment" rather than amendment.13

### **3.3 The Supreme Court: Nuance and the "Promoter" Question**

The Supreme Court, while upholding the unconstitutionality of the BBI Bill, took a more nuanced stance on the Basic Structure Doctrine. The majority of the Supreme Court judges formally rejected the applicability of the Basic Structure Doctrine in Kenya as a rigid, judicially enforceable limitation on the amendment power.14 They reasoned that the text of the Constitution (Articles 255-257) provided sufficient procedural safeguards, including referenda for key protected provisions.

However, the Supreme Court arrived at the same destination—unconstitutionality—through a different route:

1. **The "Promoter" Issue:** The Court held that the President lacks the constitutional power to initiate an amendment through the "Popular Initiative" route (Article 257). The popular initiative is a reserve of the private citizen ("Wanjiku"). The President, as a State Officer, must use the Parliamentary route (Article 256).19  
2. **Executive Overreach:** By acting as the promoter of the BBI, the President was found to have acted *ultra vires*. The Court termed the "BBI Steering Committee" established by the President as an "unconstitutional and unlawful entity".20  
3. **Public Participation:** The Court found that the process lacked meaningful public participation. The mere collection of signatures was insufficient; there was no adequate voter education or opportunity for the public to understand the 74 proposed amendments.21

### **3.4 Theoretical Implications: Yaniv Roznai and Abusive Constitutionalism**

The Kenyan courts heavily relied on the academic work of Yaniv Roznai, particularly his theories on "unconstitutional constitutional amendments" and "abusive constitutionalism".14 Roznai argues that the amendment power is a delegated power, not an absolute one. Therefore, "constituted powers" (like Parliament or the President) cannot use their amendment authority to destroy the constitution's core identity.

The BBI case illustrates the danger of "two-tiered amendment designs".14 Kenya has two paths for amendment: Parliament (Art 256\) and Popular Initiative (Art 257). The state attempted to use the Popular Initiative path because it bypasses the need for super-majorities in Parliament (which the President might not have commanded at the time) and goes directly to County Assemblies and a Referendum. By "masquerading" a state project as a popular one, the Executive engaged in abusive constitutionalism—manipulating the rules to entrench power.14

The judgment serves as a global precedent for judicial resistance to "abusive originalism" or "retrogression," where leaders attempt to restore old, centralized power structures (like the pre-2010 imperial presidency) under the guise of democratic reform.22

**4\. Legislative Capture and the Failure of Oversight: Anatomy of Three Scandals**

While the Judiciary battled constitutional interpretation, the Legislature's oversight role collapsed under the weight of state capture and corruption. The concept of "Budgeted Corruption," identified by AfriCOG, suggests that corruption in Kenya is not accidental but systemic—budgets are inflated during the planning phase with the specific intent of theft.23 This section analyzes three major scandals where Parliament failed to protect the public purse.

### **4.1 The Standard Gauge Railway (SGR): The "Jewel in the Crown of Corruption"**

The SGR project, connecting Mombasa to Nairobi, is the single most expensive infrastructure project in Kenya's history. It has also been described by former anti-corruption czar John Githongo as the "jewel in the crown of corruption".24

The "Government-to-Government" Loophole:  
The procurement of the SGR was characterized by a deliberate evasion of the Public Procurement and Disposal Act (PPDA). The Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) initially engaged the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) under the PPDA. However, realizing the rigorous transparency requirements, KRC and the Ministry of Transport switched to a "Government-to-Government" (G-to-G) financing model. This reclassification allowed them to exempt the project from competitive bidding, effectively sole-sourcing the contract to CRBC.25  
The PIC Investigation and Adan Keynan:  
The Public Investments Committee (PIC) of the 11th Parliament, chaired by Adan Keynan (Eldas MP), launched an investigation into the procurement in 2014\. The committee's findings were damning. The PIC report stated that the tender process "was marred by secrecy, opaqueness, vagueness, lack of transparency and accountability, favouritism, arbitrariness and contradictions".26  
However, in a classic display of legislative capture, the committee's final recommendations contradicted its own findings. Instead of calling for the cancellation of the tender or the prosecution of the architects, the committee recommended that the project should "proceed," merely noting that the government should ensure "value for money" in future phases.27 This capitulation allowed the project to move forward despite the acknowledged illegalities.

The Hidden Contracts and Collateral:  
The contracts remained secret for years, with the government refusing to release them despite court orders. It was only in 2022, under a new administration, that the contracts were partially released. They revealed that the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) had been used as collateral for the loans. The "take-or-pay" agreement required the KPA to guarantee a certain volume of cargo for the railway, effectively mortgaging the strategic port of Mombasa to the China Exim Bank.25 The PIC had flagged this risk in 2014, but Parliament failed to act, rendering its oversight role performative rather than substantive.

### **4.2 The Contraband Sugar Scandal (2018): Bribery in the Toilets**

In 2018, the country was rocked by reports that **contraband sugar**, some of it allegedly laced with mercury and copper, had flooded the Kenyan market. A joint parliamentary committee (Agriculture and Trade) was formed to investigate the importation, which had been facilitated by a duty-free window gazetted by Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich.30

The Bribery Allegations:  
The joint committee produced a report implicating several companies and high-ranking officials. However, when the report was tabled in the National Assembly, it was spectacularly rejected. The rejection was accompanied by widespread allegations of bribery. MPs were accused of receiving bribes ranging from KES 10,000 to KES 30,000 to shoot down the report.31  
Specific allegations emerged regarding the mechanics of the bribery:

* **The "Toilet" Payoffs:** MP Samuel Atandi (Alego Usonga) claimed that money was being shared in Parliament, specifically in the toilets and corridors, to ensure the report was rejected.32  
* **Fatuma Gedi (Wajir Woman Rep):** She was publicly accused by Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa of being one of the key figures "dishing out" money to MPs to influence the vote. Barasa claimed she tried to bribe him with KES 10,000.31  
* **Aden Duale (Majority Leader):** The then Majority Leader was accused by MP Kanini Kega of mobilizing Jubilee MPs to reject the report to protect specific importers.30 Duale had earlier promised to name the "sugar barons" but then led the charge against the report.34

Failure of Powers and Privileges:  
The Speaker, Justin Muturi, referred the bribery allegations to the Powers and Privileges Committee. Several MPs, including Fatuma Gedi, David Gikaria, and Joseph Tonui, were summoned.31 However, the investigation fizzled out. The committee's report was described by some MPs as "fake" or "straightforward," and no substantive action was taken against the bribers or the receivers.35 The scandal highlighted the complete collapse of moral integrity within the legislature, where oversight reports are essentially auctioned to the highest bidder.

### **4.3 The Betting Control Saga ("The Gambler")**

The investigative documentary *The Gambler* by **Africa Uncensored** exposed the deep entwinement of the betting industry with the Kenyan political class, revealing why Parliament struggled to regulate the sector effectively.36

Conflict of Interest:  
The investigation revealed that key policymakers and their relatives were shareholders in betting firms.

* **Paul Ndung'u:** A shareholder in **Pevans East Africa** (the owner of the **SportPesa** brand), Ndung'u was a key financier of the ruling Jubilee party. His involvement raised questions about the political protection enjoyed by the firm.37  
* **Presidential Links:** Investigative reports by *Finance Uncovered* revealed that **Peter Kihanya Muiruri**, a cousin of President Uhuru Kenyatta, held a 1% stake in Pevans East Africa. This link to the presidency was seen as a major conflict of interest, explaining the government's vacillating stance on taxation and regulation of the industry.39

The legislative attempts to tax the industry were often met with intense lobbying and threats of market exit by the betting firms. The "legislative capture" here was subtle but effective: politicians owning the very companies they were supposed to regulate ensured that the "Gambling against the Kenyan State" continued unabated.40

**5\. The Judiciary's Retreat? Public Participation and Rights**

While the Judiciary has been the primary defender of the Constitution, recent judgments suggest a potential retreat or "pragmatic" turn, particularly regarding public participation and security laws.

### **5.1 The Finance Act 2023 and the "Culture of Justification"**

The litigation over the *Finance Act 2023* centered on the sufficiency of public participation. The Act introduced controversial taxes, including the Housing Levy.

The Court of Appeal's Radical Stance:  
The Court of Appeal declared the entire Act unconstitutional. It advanced a robust interpretation of Article 10, arguing that public participation is not a mere formality. The Court held that Parliament has a constitutional obligation not just to receive views but to give reasons for accepting or rejecting them. This requirement was anchored in the "culture of justification"—the idea that in a democracy, the exercise of power must be reasoned.1 The Court ruled that accountability requires explaining why the public's views were ignored.  
The Supreme Court's Reversal (2024):  
In October 2024, the Supreme Court overturned the Court of Appeal's decision. While affirming the importance of public participation, the apex court held that there is no express constitutional requirement for Parliament to provide detailed reasons for every rejection of public views. The Court adopted a more pragmatic approach, arguing that imposing such a burden would grind the legislative process to a halt.41  
Critics argue that this judgment "blinked" in the face of executive pressure. By removing the requirement to give reasons, the Supreme Court effectively lowered the bar for public participation, allowing Parliament to treat it as a "cosmetic" exercise or a "public relations act" rather than a substantive check on legislative power.42

Mootness and the Housing Levy:  
Regarding the Housing Levy, the Supreme Court declared the issue "moot" because the government had quickly enacted a new Affordable Housing Act to replace the impugned section of the Finance Act. This tactic—rapid re-enactment to render litigation pointless—is another example of "constitutional avoidance".41

### **5.2 Zombie Laws: From Security Laws to Cybercrimes**

A persistent trend in Kenya is the "reincarnation" of unconstitutional laws.

* **Security Laws (Amendment) Act 2014 (SLAA):** Following terror attacks, the government passed the SLAA. The High Court struck down Section 29, which criminalized "false publications" that cause "panic," as unconstitutional for being vague and violating freedom of expression.43  
* **Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act 2018 (CMCA):** In 2018, Parliament enacted the CMCA. **Section 22** and **Section 23** of this new Act reintroduced the exact same offenses ("false publication") that had been struck down in the SLAA.45  
* **The BAKE Challenge:** The Bloggers Association of Kenya (BAKE) challenged these sections, arguing they were a "cut and paste" of the unconstitutional SLAA provisions. The High Court initially suspended them, but the legislative intent to criminalize speech remains a recurring threat.46 This pattern demonstrates a legislative contempt for judicial findings—when a law is struck down, it is simply renamed and passed again.

## ---

**6\. Conclusion: The Crisis of Institutional Integrity**

The fifteen-year journey of the 2010 Constitution reveals a distinct dialectic between "transformation" and "normalization."

1. **Judicial Resilience vs. Pragmatism:** The Judiciary has proven to be the most resilient branch, striking down the BBI and the CDF Acts. However, the recent Finance Act ruling suggests a potential "pragmatic drift" or fatigue in constantly confronting the political branches.  
2. **Legislative Capture:** Parliament has emerged as the "weakest link" in the constitutional architecture. Through the SGR, Sugar, and Betting scandals, it has demonstrated that it is captured by state and private interests. The "Budgeted Corruption" phenomenon means oversight is non-existent because the watchdogs are eating with the wolves.  
3. **Abusive Constitutionalism:** The political elite has mastered the art of "abusive constitutionalism"—using amendments (BBI, NG-CDF Bill 2025\) and re-enactments (Security Laws, Housing Levy) to bypass constitutional restraints.

As Kenya moves towards 2027, the central question remains whether the "paper" Constitution can survive the "political" Constitution. The "Culture of Justification" envisioned in 2010 is under siege by a resurgent "Culture of Authority" that views checks and balances not as democratic necessities, but as inconvenient hurdles to be overcome, bought off, or legislated away.
