# Threshold Poems: Philosophical Foundations for Chanuka

*These two poems serve as conceptual anchors for the Illuminations cycle—establishing the impossibility of neutrality and confronting the paralysis of the informed. They are designed to be performed at thresholds: as openings, intermissions, or digital provocations that challenge audiences to engage rather than retreat.*

## INHERITANCE OF DUST
### *On the Impossibility of Political Neutrality*

The earth remembers what bodies forget—
how each footfall is legislation,
each breath a referendum.

Between Lake Turkana's ancient shores
and the coral memories of Mombasa,
the ground holds verdicts
we never knew we gave.

Those who say they are not of politics
walk on graves without looking down.
The dust of history rises regardless,
marking their clothes,
entering lungs,
becoming cellular, constitutional.

Look—the parliament of morning light
divides the village without a single vote.
The wealthy side of the street dries first.

The man who refuses to speak
occupies the same space as speech.
His children inherit his silences
as surely as they inherit his land.
This too is governance.

Those with flames for tongues
often burn their own hands first,
their ashes indistinguishable
from those who never sparked at all.
The soil accepts both equally.

I have seen warriors paralyzed by vision—
their eyes too full of possible futures
to choose a single path through present grass.
Their prophecies, precise as mathematics,
heavy as mountains, root them in place.

In the marketplace, mangoes exchange hands
without ideology, you think,
yet someone set the price,
someone chose which trees to plant
a generation ago,
someone's grandfather decided
which roads would lead here.

When the rains finally came to Kitui,
they asked no one's permission.
The clouds gathered, indifferent
to our declarations of emergency.
This is not metaphor but consequence—
the atmosphere keeps different records
than our courthouses,
but just as binding.

The child born today in Kibera
and the child born in Muthaiga
both cry with identical lungs,
yet one breathes different futures.
Tell me this is not political.

I too have stood silent at crossroads,
mistaking stillness for neutrality,
as if standing between rivers keeps you dry.

Even termites know better—
their quiet revolutions reshape more earth
in a season than all our protest marches.
Yet we call ourselves the builders.

Tonight, as jacaranda shadows
write themselves across Nairobi walls,
remember: there is no molecule in your body
that has not been legislated,
no silence that is not also speech,
no refusal that is not also choice.

The dust we leave behind
forms a perfect record of our journey.
Whether we walked toward or away,
whether we shouted or whispered,
whether we thought ourselves
beyond the reach of consequence.

The earth remembers what bodies forget.

## THE REPUBLIC OF SILENCE
### *On Passionate Paralysis and the Myth of Neutrality*

In the republic of silence, neutrality speaks volumes,
Where ballots drift like withered leaves, unclaimed, unread.
The corridors of power—they are not elsewhere,
But within the quiet chambers of the indifferent head.

Your unwashed hands are not innocent but stained
With the invisible ink of choices unmade.
The machinery of state turns regardless,
Grinding futures in the absence of your trade.

They say the personal is never political—
A paradox that bears the weight of truth.
For in claiming no position, you become
The silent sentinel guarding someone else's booth.

The State House may decide while you decline,
A metonymy for choices you've declined to own.
The hands that could have marked the paper
Now rest empty—a synecdoche of civic bones.

I've witnessed a thousand passionate voices
Paralyzed by perfect comprehension's curse,
Their burning ideals, bright as supernovae,
Imploding under gravity of their own verse.

"Not uninformed," you whisper in defense,
A litotes that masks your full complicity.
While others scream with hyperbolic rage
That burns so hot it freezes their activity.

Between these poles, democracy stands bewildered,
An anthropomorphic entity with human doubts,
While actual humans shed their agency,
Personifying neutrality in their self-imposed drought.

History judges not just monsters and heroes
But the quiet spaces where voices should have been.
Each absence forms a present allegory—
The metaphor of silence grows cancerous within.

In this republic, we are all representatives,
Whether we campaign or not, we legislate
Through action or inaction, through voice or silence,
Through passionate paralysis or measured debate.

The voting booth, a symbol more profound
Than merely wood and curtain, pen and sheet.
It stands for all the moments when your voice
Could shift the ground beneath collective feet.

So neither burn too bright nor fade to darkness.
The middle path is not refusing to decide.
True neutrality is myth, a coincidence of privilege—
There is no shore where you can safely hide.

For even in your stillest, quietest moment,
When you believe yourself removed from all the fray,
Your silence is a ballot cast for someone,
Your indifference paves another's way.

## PERFORMANCE NOTES

**Inheritance of Dust** should be performed with gravity and accumulation—each image building on the last until the weight of the argument becomes undeniable. The speaker is patient, almost meditative, allowing the logic to unfold naturally. Ideal for opening a performance or beginning a digital experience.

**The Republic of Silence** requires a different energy—more direct, more confrontational. The formal structure (quatrains, regular meter) should feel like a prosecutorial brief, building a case the audience cannot escape. The explicit naming of literary devices is intentional: it challenges educated audiences who might use their sophistication as an excuse for inaction. Ideal for intermission or as a provocation when users show signs of disengagement.

Together, these poems establish that:
1. You are already political (Inheritance of Dust)
2. Your inaction is also a political act (The Republic of Silence)
3. Therefore, you must choose: engage consciously or enable unconsciously

They are not entertainment. They are philosophical interventions designed to close the door on neutrality before the main cycle shows what conscious engagement looks like.
