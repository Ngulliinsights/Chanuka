# **Constitutional Resilience and Institutional Decay: A Comprehensive Analysis of Judicial Review, Legislative Capture, and Rights Retrogression in Kenya**

## **1\. Introduction: The Dialectic of Transformation and Retrogression**

The promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya in 2010 was hailed globally as a "transformative" moment—a deliberate break from a past characterized by authoritarianism, impunity, and the centralization of power. It was designed not merely as a legal text but as a charter for social and political reconstruction, embedding values of integrity, separation of powers, and the sovereignty of the people.1 However, more than a decade into its implementation, the Kenyan constitutional order finds itself locked in a fierce dialectic struggle. On one side stands a judiciary that has increasingly asserted its role as the guardian of the constitution, employing novel doctrines to check executive and legislative excesses. On the other stands a political class that has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for "abusive constitutionalism"—the use of constitutional mechanisms to undermine the democratic order itself.2

This report offers an exhaustive analysis of this struggle across three critical theaters. First, it examines the contestation over the amendment power, specifically how the Kenyan courts utilized the Basic Structure Doctrine (BSD) to halt the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), a political project that exemplified the risks of "big-bang" constitutional change.3 Second, it investigates the deep-seated phenomenon of legislative capture, where the Kenyan Parliament has effectively been subordinated to private and executive interests. Through detailed case studies of the sugar import scandal, the betting industry's capture of tax policy, and the conflict of interest inherent in road construction tenders, this report demonstrates how oversight has been commodified.4 Finally, it analyzes the trajectory of national security legislation and public participation, tracing the state's persistent attempts to reintroduce draconian surveillance measures—from the Security Laws (Amendment) Act 2014 to the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act 2018—and the judiciary’s evolving jurisprudence on the "culture of justification" in fiscal matters.7

The central thesis of this analysis is that while the Kenyan Judiciary has developed a robust jurisprudential shield against *direct* assaults on the Constitution (such as the BBI), it struggles to contain the *indirect* erosion of democracy caused by legislative capture and the "zombie-like" recurrence of repressive security laws. This dynamic creates a precarious constitutional environment where formal adherence to the rule of law masks a substantive decay in democratic accountability.

**2\. The Basic Structure Doctrine and the Defense Against Abusive Constitutionalism**

The litigation surrounding the Constitution of Kenya Amendment Bill, 2020—popularly known as the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI)—represents the most significant constitutional moment in Kenya since 2010\. It forced the judiciary to grapple with fundamental questions regarding the limits of the amendment power and the nature of constituent power.

### **2.1 Theoretical Framework: Abusive Constitutionalism**

To understand the significance of the BBI judgment, one must first situate it within the global discourse on "abusive constitutionalism." Scholars David Landau and Rosalind Dixon define abusive constitutionalism as the use of the mechanisms of constitutional change—such as amendments or replacements—to erode the democratic order.9 Unlike traditional military coups, these "constitutional coups" utilize the forms of legality to achieve authoritarian ends, making them harder to detect and resist.2

In the African context, abusive constitutionalism often manifests through the removal of term limits, the weakening of judicial independence, or the dilution of checks and balances. The BBI fitted this pattern; it was an elite pact disguised as a popular initiative. It proposed 74 amendments in a single omnibus bill, which included creating a Prime Minister's post, expanding the legislature, and—crucially—introducing a Judiciary Ombudsman appointed by the Executive.11 This latter proposal was a direct threat to judicial independence, a core pillar of the 2010 Constitution.

The BBI also exemplified the danger of "big-bang constitutional amendments"—rapid, large-scale changes introduced simultaneously to overwhelm public scrutiny and force a binary choice on complex governance issues.3 By bundling popular proposals (such as increased county allocations) with regime-entrenching clauses (executive expansion), the BBI promoters sought to "sweeten" an authoritarian power grab.

### **2.2 The High Court and Court of Appeal: Importing the Basic Structure Doctrine**

The High Court's judgment in the BBI case was described by legal scholars as "an instant classic" and a paragon of transformative constitutionalism.1 The Court held that the **Basic Structure Doctrine (BSD)**—originally cemented in the Indian Supreme Court case of *Kesavananda Bharati*—applies in Kenya. This doctrine posits that certain foundational features of a constitution are unamendable, or at least require a process more rigorous than the standard amendment procedure to alter.

The Kenyan courts reasoned that the power to amend the Constitution (constituted power) is distinct from the power to make a constitution (constituent power). The BBI, by attempting to alter the fundamental structure of the state (the "basic structure"), triggered the need for the exercise of the *primary constituent power* of the people. The Court of Appeal upheld this view, establishing that the primary constituent power must be exercised in four specific sequential stages for any amendment altering the basic structure:

1. **Civic Education:** Ensuring the public is sufficiently informed about the proposed changes.  
2. **Public Participation:** The collection of views from the citizenry, ensuring their voice shapes the draft.  
3. **Constituent Assembly:** Deliberation by specially elected representatives, distinct from the regular Parliament.  
4. **Referendum:** The final adoption or rejection by the people.1

This procedural rigidity was designed to counter the ease with which political elites could manipulate the "popular initiative" route under Article 257\. The courts argued that without these safeguards, the amendment power could be weaponized to dismantle the Constitution itself. As scholar Yaniv Roznai notes, this approach protects the "identity" and "core structure" of the constitution from being hollowed out by transient political majorities.12

### **2.3 The Supreme Court's Nuanced Rejection and the "Eternity Clause"**

While the Court of Appeal largely upheld the BSD, the Supreme Court of Kenya adopted a more textualist stance in its final judgment. Chief Justice Martha Koome and the majority formally rejected the applicability of the Basic Structure Doctrine in Kenya as an abstract judicial creation. Instead, they argued that the text of **Article 255** of the Constitution already provides a codified basic structure.13

Article 255 acts as a tier-based protection mechanism. It lists specific matters—such as the supremacy of the Constitution, the territory of Kenya, the Bill of Rights, and the term of office of the President—that require approval by referendum.11 The Supreme Court viewed this as an indigenous "eternity clause" (or at least a "hard-to-amend" clause) that rendered the importation of the Indian BSD unnecessary.

However, the Supreme Court's rejection of the BSD was not a victory for the BBI promoters. The Court halted the BBI on procedural grounds, ruling that the President (Uhuru Kenyatta) could not initiate a "popular initiative" under Article 257\. The Court held that the popular initiative route is reserved for "Wanjiku" (the ordinary citizen) and that the President, having access to the parliamentary initiative route (Article 256), could not usurp the people's avenue.1 This finding reinforced the separation of powers and checked executive overreach.

The "fractured" nature of the Supreme Court's verdict—with seven separate opinions—leaves the door open for future courts to revisit the BSD.13 As noted in the snippets, the separate opinions provide a rich resource for future "tailored challenges" to constitutional amendments, suggesting that while the doctrine was formally rejected, its spirit of protecting the constitutional core remains alive in Kenyan jurisprudence.13

### **2.4 Comparative Implications: The Kenyan Contribution**

The Kenyan judiciary's handling of the BBI case contributes significantly to Comparative Political Process Theory (CPPT). In many African jurisdictions, the Basic Structure Doctrine has been viewed with suspicion or ignored to facilitate authoritarian consolidation.14 By anchoring their decision in the specific history of Kenya's struggle for democracy and the "transformative" intent of the 2010 Constitution, the Kenyan courts demonstrated how "process-based concerns"—specifically the quality of public participation—can be used to strike down abusive amendments without necessarily locking the constitution in place permanently.9

The judgment clarifies that "We the People" acts as a continuous check on power, not merely as a ratifier of elite bargains. It asserts that for a constitutional moment to be valid, it must manifest the genuine will of the people, not just "Oui, the People" acquiescing to an executive directive.1

**3\. Legislative Capture and the Crisis of Representation**

While the Judiciary has erected barriers against executive overreach, the Kenyan Parliament has increasingly exhibited symptoms of **legislative capture**. Legislative capture is defined as a situation where the policy agenda of the legislature is disproportionately driven by the interests of a narrow constituency—often corporate or personal—rather than the public good.4 This phenomenon is distinct from mere lobbying; it involves the systemic subordination of public duty to private gain, often facilitated by conflict of interest where legislators act as contractors, shareholders, or beneficiaries of the very sectors they are mandated to oversee.

Theoretical literature suggests that legislative capture leads to "deleterious" policy consequences, including the distortion of economic incentives and the entrenchment of inequality.4 In Kenya, this capture is not subtle; it is institutionalized and brazen, as evidenced by the following case studies.

### **3.1 The Sugar Report: A Case Study in Institutional Bribery**

The investigation into the importation of contraband and contaminated sugar in 2018 stands as a stark example of legislative capture through direct pecuniary inducement. A joint parliamentary committee (Trade and Agriculture) was tasked with investigating the influx of illicit sugar that reportedly contained mercury and copper, threatening both public health and the local sugar industry.

The Rejection of the Report:  
In a chaotic session that shocked the nation, Parliament overwhelmingly rejected the joint committee's report. The rejection was not based on substantive disagreement with the findings but was allegedly orchestrated through the massive bribery of Members of Parliament (MPs). Reports indicated that MPs were offered bribes ranging from KSh 10,000 to KSh 30,000 to shoot down the report.15  
**The Actors and the Mechanism:**

* **Fatuma Gedi (Wajir Woman Representative):** Ms. Gedi was accused of actively "dishing out bribes" to MPs to influence their voting. Accusations claimed she distributed money within the precincts of Parliament, specifically lobbying members to reject the report.15 While she vehemently denied these allegations, claiming the report was rejected on merit, the spectacle severely damaged the credibility of the House.15  
* **Didmus Barasa (MP):** Barasa publicly claimed to have witnessed the bribery, stating that members were being compromised to protect the "sugar barons" implicated in the scandal. He challenged the Speaker to play back CCTV footage to prove the bribery took place.16  
* **Kiambu Woman Representative:** Maintained that MPs "lined up for bribes," corroborating the allegations of systemic corruption.15

The Consequence:  
The rejection of the report meant that the importers responsible for flooding the market with poisonous sugar faced no parliamentary sanction. This is a textbook definition of capture: the legislative output (or lack thereof) was purchased by the target of the oversight, rendering the accountability mechanism void. The Speaker of the House subsequently faced calls to invite the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to investigate the House itself, signaling a total breakdown of internal integrity mechanisms.17

### **3.2 The Betting Industry: The Nexus of Lawmaking and Shareholding**

The betting and gambling sector in Kenya provides a compelling case of **conflict of interest** where the line between the regulator (Parliament) and the regulated (Betting Companies) is obliterated.

Parliamentary Shareholders:  
Research and investigative reports have revealed that key political figures held significant equity stakes in major betting firms while the House debated gaming taxes and regulations.

* **Ronald Karauri (MP & CEO):** Ronald Karauri, the Member of Parliament for Kasarani, simultaneously served as the CEO and a significant shareholder (7% stake) in **SportPesa**, Kenya’s largest betting firm.6 This creates an insurmountable conflict of interest: as an MP, he debates the Finance Acts that set excise duties on betting stakes, while as a CEO/Shareholder, his primary fiduciary duty is to maximize SportPesa's profit.  
* **Shareholding Structure:** Other political elites identified as shareholders in the betting ecosystem include **Paul Wanderi Ndung’u** (17% stake in Pevans East Africa/SportPesa) and former Nairobi Mayor **Dick Wathika** (deceased), whose estate retained a 21% stake.6 The betting firm *Milestone Games Limited*, which later took over the SportPesa brand, was also linked to Karauri through opaque shareholding layers, leading to conflicts with the Betting Control and Licensing Board (BCLB).20

Legislative Impact:  
The presence of these interests correlates with the volatility of betting taxation laws. The Finance Act 2019 initially proposed a 20% excise duty on betting stakes, leading to a standoff where firms like SportPesa threatened to exit the market.22 The subsequent "see-saw" of tax amendments—where taxes are introduced, then reduced, then reintroduced—reflects the intense lobbying power of the industry within the House. The BCLB has frequently clashed with these firms over licensing, yet the parliamentary oversight committees often provide a soft landing or a platform for industry pushback against the regulator. For instance, MPs have openly criticized the BCLB for being too harsh on the industry, a position that aligns with their private financial interests.22

### **3.3 The Roads Sector: The Legislator as Contractor**

The construction of roads in Kenya is plagued by a structural conflict of interest entrenched by the **Kenya Roads Board Act, 1999** (and subsequent amendments). This Act established **Constituency Roads Committees (CRCs)**, which are responsible for prioritizing road projects and overseeing expenditure at the local level.

Structural Capture:  
MPs sit as patrons or members of these committees.5 This allows them to:

1. Select which roads are tarmac/graded.  
2. Influence the award of tenders to specific companies.  
3. Oversee the execution of the work.

This fusion of roles violates the separation of powers. The MP, whose constitutional role is oversight, becomes an implementer. The World Bank and academic studies note that this form of "clientelism" leads to the selection of projects based on political loyalty rather than economic utility.4

The Case of Bernard Shinali (Ikolomani MP):  
The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) flagged a severe case involving Bernard Shinali, the MP for Ikolomani.

* **Allegation:** The EACC investigated allegations of conflict of interest, abuse of office, and procurement irregularities regarding a Senior Accountant at the **Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA)** who was simultaneously the MP for Ikolomani.25  
* **Scope:** The inquiry covered the award of tenders totaling approximately **KSh 817 million** across multiple agencies, including KeRRA, Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), and Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA).26  
* **Mechanism:** The conflict arises because KeRRA is the agency responsible for rural roads, the very projects the MP oversees via the Constituency Roads Committee. For an MP to be linked to the accounting or tendering processes of the agency they supervise constitutes a complete capture of the procurement cycle.  
* **Outcome:** Despite the gravity of the allegations, Shinali has remained a vocal defender of constituency funds and continued to serve in Parliament.27 This illustrates the impunity with which conflict of interest is treated within the legislative body.

### **3.4 The NG-CDF: Institutionalized Breach of Separation of Powers**

The **National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF)** is the statutory vehicle that formalizes legislative capture in Kenya. It allocates 2.5% of national revenue to constituencies for development projects, ostensibly to devolve resources.

**Judicial Findings:**

* **2015 High Court Ruling:** Declared the CDF Act 2013 unconstitutional because it involved MPs in the *implementation* of projects, a function reserved for the Executive.28 The Court cited a violation of the separation of powers and the principle of devolution.  
* **2022 Supreme Court Ruling:** Struck down the CDF Act 2013 again, noting that it treated the constituency as a unit of service delivery rather than representation.29  
* **2024 High Court Ruling:** In September 2024, a three-judge bench declared the **NG-CDF Act 2015** unconstitutional. Despite amendments attempting to remove MPs from direct management (making them "patrons"), the Court found that MPs still "remained in the shadows," controlling the fund remotely through the appointment of committee members.28

The persistence of the NG-CDF, despite repeated nullification by the courts, underscores the legislature's refusal to relinquish control over executive funds. MPs view the fund as essential for patronage (bursaries and local projects) and re-election, prioritizing these political benefits over constitutional adherence.31 The EACC has noted that the fund is rife with embezzlement and mismanagement, yet Parliament consistently votes to increase its allocation.32

**4\. The Security-Rights Balance and the Evolution of Public Participation**

The third dimension of Kenya's constitutional struggle takes place in the arena of national security legislation and the procedural safeguard of public participation. This reflects a tension between the state's impulse to securitize governance—often justifying rights limitations with the threat of terrorism—and the judiciary's insistence on a "culture of justification."

### **4.1 The Security Laws (Amendment) Act 2014: Panic and Authoritarianism**

Following the horrific terrorist attacks at Westgate Mall (2013) and Mandera (2014), the Executive rushed the **Security Laws (Amendment) Bill 2014** through Parliament. The Bill was characterized by acrimonious debate, chaos, and physical brawls in the House, illustrating the breakdown of deliberative democracy.7

Key Provisions and Judicial Review:  
The Act sought to amend over 20 different laws, introducing sweeping powers for the National Intelligence Service (NIS) and the police.

* **Surveillance:** It allowed for the interception of communications without sufficient procedural safeguards, effectively bypassing Article 31 (Right to Privacy).33  
* **Media Restrictions:** It criminalized the publication of images of victims of terror attacks without police consent, a direct attack on Article 34 (Freedom of Media).  
* **The CORD Case:** In *Coalition for Reform and Democracy (CORD) & others v Republic of Kenya*, the High Court declared eight key sections of the Act unconstitutional. The Court ruled that national security could not be used as a blanket excuse to suspend the Bill of Rights. It emphasized that even in fighting terror, the state must adhere to the rule of law.7

### **4.2 The Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act (CMCA) 2018: The "Zombie" Legislation**

Despite the 2015 ruling, the state reintroduced several repressive provisions through the **Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act (CMCA) 2018**. This phenomenon, often termed "zombie legislation," involves the re-enactment of unconstitutional clauses in new statutes.

Re-introduction of Suppressed Clauses:  
Civil society groups, particularly the Bloggers Association of Kenya (BAKE), argued that the CMCA was a reincarnation of the rejected SLAA 2014 provisions.

* **Section 22 and 23:** These sections granted authorities broad powers to search, seize, and intercept data from computer systems. BAKE argued these mirrored the unconstitutional surveillance powers struck down in 2015\.34  
* **Result:** In *BAKE v Attorney General* (2020), the High Court initially suspended 23 sections of the Act. However, in a later ruling, the Court upheld the Act's constitutionality, arguing that the limitations on privacy were justifiable in the digital age.35 This shift represents a judicial deference to security concerns regarding cybercrime, contrasting with the hardline stance taken against the SLAA 2014\. Critics argue that vague definitions of "fake news" and "cyber harassment" in the Act continue to be used to silence dissent and target journalists.36

### **4.3 Public Participation: The New "Basic Structure"**

If the Basic Structure Doctrine is the shield against constitutional dismemberment, **Public Participation** (Article 118 and Article 10\) has become the sword against legislative impunity, particularly in finance and tax matters.

**The Evolution of Jurisprudence:**

* **Finance Act 2018:** The Kenya Bankers Association challenged the retrospective application of excise duty, arguing lack of public participation. The High Court ruled that while retrospective tax is not inherently unconstitutional, the lack of public participation in the *specific* amendment (increasing duty from 10% to 20%) was a violation. However, the Court often issued declarations of invalidity suspended for a period, or "soft-form" review, to avoid fiscal chaos.37  
* **Finance Act 2023:** The Court of Appeal’s judgment on the Finance Act 2023 represents the zenith of this jurisprudence. The Court declared the Act unconstitutional largely due to a flawed public participation process.  
  * **The "Why" Matters:** The Court held that Parliament cannot simply "facilitate" participation; it must demonstrate *how* the views were considered. It established that Parliament has a duty to **provide reasons** for rejecting public views. This moves Kenya toward a **"culture of justification"**, where exercises of public power must be reasoned, transparent, and responsive.8  
  * **Supreme Court Reversal (2024):** In a dramatic turn, the Supreme Court in late 2024 overturned the Court of Appeal, declaring the Finance Act 2023 constitutional. The apex court ruled that the obligation to give reasons for every rejected view would be administratively impossible and was not explicitly demanded by the text of the Constitution.40 This ruling seemingly retreats from the expansive "culture of justification," returning to a more procedural understanding of participation.

The Finance Bill 2024 Crisis:  
The tension culminated in the Finance Bill 2024 protests (Gen Z protests). Following the storming of Parliament by protesters—who felt their participation via memoranda had been ignored—President Ruto declined to assent to the Bill.42 This event underscored that when formal mechanisms of participation are rendered performative by legislative capture, the public may resort to Article 1 (Sovereign Power) directly. The rejection of the Finance Bill 2024 by the street, after Parliament had passed it, represents the ultimate vote of no confidence in the legislature's ability to represent the people.

**6\. Conclusion**

The analysis of Kenya’s constitutional trajectory from 2010 to 2024 reveals a constitutional order under siege, yet remarkably resilient. The Judiciary has proven to be a critical guardian, willing to deploy heavy jurisprudential artillery—such as the Basic Structure Doctrine—to repel existential threats like the BBI. The courts have also attempted, with varying degrees of success, to enforce a "culture of justification" regarding public participation, forcing the state to listen to its citizens.

However, the efficacy of these legal victories is constantly undermined by a legislature that has been effectively captured by private and executive interests. The evidence of legislative capture is not merely anecdotal but structural. The rejection of the Sugar Report due to bribery, the intertwining of MPs and betting firms, and the blatant conflict of interest in the roads sector demonstrate that Parliament often functions as a marketplace for private interests rather than a house of representation. This capture necessitates the continued "judicialization of politics," where courts are forced to resolve issues that a functioning legislature should have handled.

Furthermore, the state's persistent attempts to reintroduce repressive security laws through new vehicles indicate an executive intent to erode the Bill of Rights, necessitating constant vigilance from civil society and the courts. The future of Kenyan constitutionalism, therefore, lies in the balance between an assertive, interpretative Judiciary and a Parliament that currently appears unable—or unwilling—to disentangle itself from the webs of capture and conflict of interest. As the BBI judgment emphasized, the ultimate guardian of the constitution remains the people themselves, who must continuously exercise their primary constituent power to protect the democratic order.1
