### **Multi-Track Approach:**

**Track 1: B2B Revenue (Primary)**
- KBA association license: KSh 7.8M/year potential
- Individual banks: 46 potential customers @ KSh 2-5M each
- Law firms through LSK partnership
- Corporate subscriptions

**Track 2: Philanthropic Grants (Supporting)**
- Digital rights funders (Luminate, OSF, Mozilla)
- Development funders (Ford, Mastercard, UNDP)

### **Sustainability Thesis (for Omidyar/Business-minded funders):**
