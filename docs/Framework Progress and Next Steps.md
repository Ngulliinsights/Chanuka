# **Assessing the Constitutional Architecture: Vulnerabilities, Legislative Capability, and the Crisis of Implementation in Kenya**

## **1\. Introduction: The Unfulfilled Promise of the "Second Independence"**

The promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya in 2010 was widely interpreted by legal scholars, political scientists, and the citizenry as a moment of "second independence," a foundational reset designed to dismantle the centralized, authoritarian structures of the post-colonial state. This transformative charter sought to replace the "Imperial Presidency"—a term popularized by former President Mwai Kibaki to describe an executive with excessive power and insufficient accountability—with a system predicated on the sovereignty of the people, the rule of law, and robust checks and balances.1 The overarching objective was to deconstruct the legacy of a coercive state characterized by ethnic patronage and impunity, and to reconstruct a polity grounded in national values and principles of governance as articulated in Article 10\.

However, more than a decade into its implementation, a profound chasm has emerged between the constitutional text and the political reality. While the institutional architecture has undeniably changed—featuring a bicameral legislature, 47 devolved county governments, and independent constitutional commissions—the underlying culture of governance has proven remarkably resilient to reform. The structural vulnerabilities of the 2010 Constitution lie not necessarily in its drafting, but in the systematic exploitation of legislative loopholes, the weaponization of parliamentary procedure, and a profound deficit in "elite legislative literacy"—the capacity of legislators to critically engage with complex statutory instruments, fiscal frameworks, and technocratic bills.1

This report posits that the failure to fully realize the constitutional promise is driven by two concurrent and reinforcing phenomena: "State Capture," where public institutions are repurposed for private profiteering 4, and "Legislative Atrophy," where Parliament, through a combination of incompetence, partisanship, and executive co-optation, has abdicated its role as a countervailing power. Furthermore, the analysis identifies underutilized constitutional provisions—specifically Articles 35, 119, and 258—that offer citizens potential pathways to reclaim the civic space, provided the judiciary remains a bulwark against executive overreach.

### **1.1 The Legacy of the Imperial Presidency and Structural Inertia**

The transition from an imperial presidency to a constitutional democracy remains incomplete. The 2010 Constitution was explicitly designed to curb the powers of the President, who previously held sway over the legislature and the judiciary. Yet, the political elite have adeptly maneuvered within the new framework to reassert control. As noted by the Katiba Institute, the presidential system imposed by the Parliamentary Select Committee in the final stages of drafting was justified on the premise that the US-style system offered sufficient checks and balances.1 However, in practice, the Kenyan executive has retained disproportionate influence, often bypassing the legislature or using its parliamentary majority to rubber-stamp policy.

This structural inertia is evident in the legislative process itself. Unlike the US Congress, where negotiations often lead to substantive changes in bills, the Kenyan Parliament frequently acts as a conveyor belt for the Executive. The President's power to refer bills back to Parliament with reservations has been used effectively to force legislative capitulation, as seen in various finance and security laws.1 The "tyranny of numbers" has replaced the "tyranny of the single party," rendering the constitution's checks and balances ineffective in the face of a disciplined ruling coalition.

### **1.2 Defining Elite Legislative Literacy**

A critical, yet under-examined, factor in this governance deficit is the concept of "elite legislative literacy." This refers not merely to the educational qualifications of Members of Parliament (MPs)—though the debate over degree requirements is relevant 5—but to their technical capacity to understand, scrutinize, and amend complex legislation. The complexity of modern governance, particularly in areas such as public debt management, digital identity infrastructure (Maisha Namba), and statutory instruments, requires a level of technical comprehension that is often lacking in the House.

This literacy gap creates a vulnerability where the Executive, backed by technocrats at the National Treasury or the Attorney General's office, can introduce legislation with far-reaching constitutional implications (e.g., raising the debt ceiling via the PFM Act) that passes with minimal substantive debate. The reliance on "participation washing"—where public participation is treated as a procedural formality rather than a substantive engagement—further exacerbates this issue, as Parliament fails to translate public feedback into legislative amendments.7

**2\. Structural Vulnerabilities and State Capture**

The phenomenon of state capture in Kenya has evolved from the crude looting of the pre-2010 era to a more sophisticated repurposing of legal and institutional mechanisms. The Africa Centre for Open Governance (AfriCOG) diagnoses this as the "re-purposing of state institutions for private profiteering," where anti-corruption efforts are weaponized for partisan ends rather than genuine accountability.4 This systemic corruption is not an aberration but a feature of the political economy, deeply entrenched despite the proliferation of new institutions.

### **2.1 The Mutilation of Chapter Six: Leadership and Integrity**

Chapter Six of the Constitution was intended to be the cornerstone of the new ethical order, setting high standards for leadership and integrity. It requires State officers to demonstrate personal integrity, competence, and suitability. However, the enforcement of Chapter Six has been systematically undermined by a combination of weak implementing legislation and judicial restraint.

The *Leadership and Integrity Act*, enacted to operationalize Chapter Six, was severely diluted by the Cabinet before it reached Parliament. The Cabinet removed proposed procedures for vetting candidates and deleted requirements for the declaration of assets and liabilities, effectively stripping the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) of its enforcement teeth.9 The High Court, in a controversial ruling, upheld the constitutionality of this watered-down Act, arguing that courts are concerned with the *power* to enact statutes, not their *wisdom*. This judicial restraint effectively sanctioned the legislative sabotage of constitutional values.9

Consequently, the EACC struggles to enforce integrity standards. While the Commission has recovered approximately Ksh 40 billion in corruptly acquired assets since 2011 10, the political class continues to operate with impunity. The "integrity test" for candidates seeking elective office has been reduced to a procedural clearance, allowing individuals with questionable records to occupy state offices. This failure is a direct result of "elite legislative literacy" being used to *deconstruct* rather than *uphold* the Constitution; legislators understood exactly how to craft the law to protect their interests while maintaining a veneer of constitutional compliance.11

### **2.2 The Weaponization of Parliament and the "Tyranny of Numbers"**

The design of the 2010 Constitution assumed a Parliament that would act as an independent check on the Executive. However, the political reality of coalition building has rendered this assumption void. The "tyranny of numbers"—the ability of the ruling coalition to marshal votes regardless of the merits of a motion—has been used to pass laws that arguably contravene the spirit of the Constitution.

This was evident in the passage of the Security Laws (Amendment) Act of 2014 and various Finance Acts. Mzalendo Trust’s parliamentary scorecards reveal a worrying trend where MPs prioritize political allegiance over legislative scrutiny.12 The 2024 scorecard noted chronic absenteeism and a lack of quorum during debates on critical issues like the deployment of police to Haiti and the rising femicide cases.12 This "legislative atrophy" allows the Executive to govern with minimal oversight, as Parliament fails to exercise its powers of budgetary control and legislative review.

### **2.3 Ethnic Dominance and Exclusion in Public Service**

The Constitution mandates that public service employment must reflect the face of Kenya (Article 232). However, data from the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) reveals persistent ethnic hegemony. A 2024 report indicates that five major ethnic communities occupy over 70% of all jobs in state corporations, with the Kikuyu and Kalenjin communities significantly overrepresented.14

This exclusion is not merely a failure of implementation but a structural vulnerability perpetuated by elite capture. The recruitment processes, ostensibly meritocratic, are manipulated to reward ethnic constituencies, thereby cementing the "ethnocentric state" that the 2010 Constitution sought to dismantle.15 The Parliament’s Committee on National Cohesion and Equal Opportunity has called for diversity audits, but without strong legislative enforcement mechanisms—such as withholding funds from non-compliant agencies—these reports remain advisory.17

**Table 1: Ethnic Representation in Public Service vs. Constitutional Mandate**

| Metric | Constitutional Requirement (Art. 232\) | Current Status (NCIC 2024 Report) | Implication |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Ethnic Balance** | "Representation of Kenya's diverse communities" | 5 communities hold \>70% of state jobs 14 | Systemic exclusion of minority groups; entrenched patronage networks. |
| **Recruitment Basis** | "Fair competition and merit" | Skewed towards dominant ethnic coalitions | Erosion of public trust; inefficiency in service delivery. |
| **Regional Balance** | Equitable distribution of opportunities | High concentration in specific regions (e.g., Central, Rift Valley) | Violates Article 27 (Non-discrimination); fuels political grievance. |
| **Oversight Mechanism** | NCIC and PSC monitoring | Reports issued but recommendations largely ignored | Legislative impotence; lack of sanctions for non-compliance. |

**3\. The Fiscal Constitution: Debt Management and Legislative Loopholes**

One of the most glaring examples of elite legislative literacy gaps and constitutional vulnerability is the management of public debt. The Public Finance Management (PFM) Act, 2012, was enacted to operationalize Chapter 12 of the Constitution, which demands openness, accountability, and public participation in financial matters. However, the legal framework governing debt has been progressively weakened through legislative amendments that escape broad public scrutiny.

### **3.1 From Debt Ceiling to Debt Anchor: The PFM Act Amendments**

The PFM Act initially set a numerical debt ceiling, providing a clear, tangible limit on government borrowing. However, the National Treasury, with Parliamentary approval, shifted this framework to a "debt anchor" based on a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In October 2023, the debt anchor was set at 55% of GDP in present value terms, replacing the Ksh 10 trillion numerical limit.19

While technically defensible in macroeconomic terms, this shift represents a profound vulnerability in transparency.

* **Complexity as Camouflage:** A numerical ceiling (e.g., Ksh 10 trillion) is easily understood by the public and MPs. A percentage of GDP is abstract, subject to revision based on rebased economic data, and difficult for non-experts to monitor.  
* **Legislative Abdication:** By amending Section 50 of the PFM Act to replace "limit" with "threshold," Parliament effectively surrendered its power to set a hard cap on borrowing. The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) and other civil society actors warned that this change "makes no legal difference for public debt levels" if not enforced, yet the Public Debt and Privatization Committee rubber-stamped the amendment, arguing it "does not materially alter the objective".20

### **3.2 The Okiya Omtatah Litigation and the Definition of "Public Debt"**

Senator Okiya Omtatah has been a pivotal figure in using Article 258 (enforcement of the Constitution) to challenge these fiscal maneuvers. In *Cabinet Secretary for the National Treasury and Planning & Others v Okiya Omtatah Okoiti & Others*, the Supreme Court had to grapple with the constitutionality of the Finance Act 2023 and the procedural validity of debt management decisions.21

A critical area of contention has been the definition of "public debt." The Treasury sought to amend the PFM Act to align the definition with Article 214(2) of the Constitution but arguably introduced vagueness to allow for more borrowing headroom.23 Civil society organizations like TISA argued that removing the word "public" from "county public debt" would dilute accountability, yet these technical amendments often pass without robust plenary debate due to the low technical literacy of many legislators regarding fiscal statutes.20

### **3.3 The Failure of Parliamentary Oversight Committees**

The PFM Act established the Public Debt Management Office (PDMO) to manage borrowing costs and advise the Cabinet Secretary. Crucially, the head of this office is meant to be recruited competitively to ensure independence. However, the PDMO operates under the National Treasury, limiting its ability to offer independent counsel to Parliament.24

Civil society proposals to have the PDMO advise Parliament directly—thereby giving the legislature an independent source of technical analysis—were rejected by the Parliamentary Committee on the grounds of "separation of powers".20 This decision illustrates a failure of legislative literacy: MPs failed to recognize that by rejecting independent technical advice, they reinforced their own dependence on the Treasury's data, thereby undermining their oversight mandate. The Parliament Budget Office (PBO) exists to fill this gap, but its recommendations are often ignored in favor of partisan positions.25

**Table 2: Evolution of Public Debt Control Mechanisms**

| Mechanism | Legal Basis | Status | Implication for Oversight |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Numerical Ceiling** | PFM Act (Original) | Repealed | High transparency; easy for public/MPs to monitor. Hard cap on borrowing. |
| **Percentage of GDP (55%)** | PFM (Amendment) Act 2023 | Active | Low transparency; relies on complex GDP calculations. Allows moving goalposts. |
| **Debt Anchor Breach Reporting** | PFM Act Sec. 50(2) | Active | CS Treasury must explain breaches to Parliament. Often treated as a formality. |
| **Parliamentary Approval** | Article 211 | Active | Theoretically robust, but often exercised via party whipping ("Tyranny of Numbers"). |

### **3.4 Supplementary Budgets as Debt Vehicles**

The misuse of supplementary budgets represents another critical vulnerability. The International Budget Partnership (IBP) Kenya notes that supplementary budgets are frequently used to introduce new budget lines and increase the deficit without the rigorous public participation required for the main budget.26 The PFM Act allows for limited deviations, but in practice, these budgets have become a tool for the Executive to bypass fiscal constraints and introduce debt-funded projects that were not subjected to initial scrutiny. This practice thrives because the legislative review of supplementary budgets is often rushed, and MPs lack the time or expertise to interrogate line-item shifts effectively.27

**4\. The Crisis of Public Participation: "Participation Washing"**

Public participation is a national value under Article 10 of the Constitution. It was intended to legitimize the legislative process and ensure that laws reflect the will of the sovereign people. However, the implementation of this principle has degenerated into "participation washing"—a performative exercise where public views are collected but systematically ignored.

### **4.1 The Finance Act 2023 Judgment: A Watershed Moment**

The litigation surrounding the Finance Act 2023 exposed the hollowness of the current public participation framework. The Court of Appeal initially declared the Act unconstitutional because the National Assembly failed to provide reasons for adopting or rejecting public proposals.28 The Court held that "meaningful public participation" requires a feedback loop; citizens must know *why* their views were disregarded.

However, the Supreme Court overturned this decision, ruling that the Parliament had met the "threshold of a reasonable measure".22 This ruling effectively lowered the bar for public participation, signaling that procedural compliance (holding forums) is sufficient, even if substantive compliance (incorporating views) is lacking. This creates a significant constitutional vulnerability: if Parliament can ignore public input without legal consequence, Article 118 (Public Access and Participation) becomes a toothless provision.

### **4.2 The Lack of a Statutory Framework**

A major gap identified by the courts and civil society is the absence of a comprehensive *Public Participation Act*. While various bills have been proposed (e.g., Public Participation Bill 2024/2025), none have been enacted.30 Without a statutory framework defining the *metrics* of participation—such as timelines, access to information, and mandatory feedback mechanisms—institutions operate with wide discretion.

The *Public Participation Bill 2025* attempts to cure this by establishing "Responsible Authorities" and mandating "public participation plans".31 However, until this is law, the Executive continues to exploit the vacuum. For instance, the "Maisha Namba" digital ID rollout was challenged precisely because regulations were gazetted with minimal public engagement, violating Article 35 (Access to Information) and Article 10\.32

### **4.3 Manipulation of Reports**

Evidence suggests that parliamentary committees often manipulate public participation reports. The "cognitive engagement theory" implies that participation is meaningful only when citizens are informed. Yet, reports are often tabled with pre-determined outcomes. In the case of the Finance Bill 2023, substantive amendments were introduced *after* public participation had concluded, a practice the Court of Appeal termed unconstitutional before the Supreme Court's intervention.22 This "bait-and-switch" tactic relies on the public's inability to track real-time legislative changes—a gap Mzalendo Trust attempts to fill but which remains a systemic flaw.34

## ---

**5\. Elite Legislative Literacy and Capacity Deficits**

The inability of Parliament to effectively check the Executive is deeply rooted in capacity deficits. While MPs are required to have post-secondary qualifications (a requirement that has faced legal challenges), formal education does not equate to *legislative literacy*.

### **5.1 The Education Qualification Debate**

The Elections Act (2011) initially required MPs to have post-secondary education. This was challenged as discriminatory. Proponents argue that legislative work—oversight, budget analysis, vetting—requires high literacy. Opponents argue it excludes the majority of Kenyans.5

*Insight:* The focus on "degrees" misses the point. "Legislative literacy" is specific. A doctor or engineer may have a degree but lack the skills to parse a Finance Bill or a complex Statutory Instrument. The real gap is *institutional capacity*. The Parliamentary Research Services (PRS) and Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) exist, but MPs often ignore their technical advice in favor of political expediency.25

### **5.2 The Quality of Parliamentary Debate**

Mzalendo Trust, a parliamentary monitoring organization, has consistently highlighted the disconnect between the quantity and quality of debate. Their scorecards reveal that many MPs rarely speak, and when they do, contributions are often parochial rather than policy-oriented.12

The "quality" of debate is further compromised by the sheer volume of technical legislation. The *Statutory Instruments Act* allows Parliament to annul regulations made by Cabinet Secretaries. However, the volume of regulations (e.g., on taxes, digital ID, environmental levies) overwhelms the Committee on Delegated Legislation. The Executive exploits this by pushing through controversial policies via regulations (subsidiary legislation) rather than primary Acts, knowing that scrutiny will be less intense.36 This was the strategy used in the Maisha Namba rollout, where amendments to the Registration of Persons Act were done via regulations to avoid a full parliamentary process.33

### **5.3 The Role of the Centre for Parliamentary Studies and Training (CPST)**

The CPST was established to bridge the capacity gap. It offers induction courses and training on legislative drafting and budget analysis.38 However, the curriculum's impact is limited by the high turnover of MPs (often 60-70% per election cycle) and the lack of mandatory continuous professional development.

There is a specific deficit in *legislative drafting* skills among MPs. While government bills are drafted by the Office of the Attorney General or the Kenya Law Reform Commission (KLRC), Private Member Bills often suffer from poor drafting, leading to their collapse or unconstitutionality.40 The CPST offers "advanced courses" in drafting, but these are often targeted at staff rather than members.41 Strengthening the *legislative impact assessment* module within the CPST curriculum is a crucial, underutilized lever for reform.42

### **5.4 Legislative Impact Assessment (LIA)**

Kenya lacks a formalized system for *Legislative Impact Assessment* (LIA) or *Regulatory Impact Assessment* (RIA) that is binding on Parliament. While the Statutory Instruments Act requires an RIA for regulations, there is no equivalent requirement for primary legislation to undergo a rigorous economic or social impact assessment before passage.43 This allows populist or technically flawed bills to become law, only to be struck down by the courts later. Introducing a mandatory LIA framework, similar to those in the Commonwealth, would force MPs to engage with the technical realities of their proposals.44

## ---

**6\. Statutory Instruments: Governance by Stealth**

The abuse of the Statutory Instruments Act represents a sophisticated form of executive overreach. By using subsidiary legislation to implement substantive policy changes, the Executive bypasses the rigorous three-reading process required for primary bills.

### **6.1 The Maisha Namba Case Study**

The rollout of the Maisha Namba digital identity ecosystem provides a clear case study of this vulnerability. Rather than introducing a new substantive Act to govern this massive data infrastructure, the government opted to amend the *Registration of Persons Act* through regulations.32 Civil society organizations, including Haki na Sheria and Katiba Institute, challenged this in court, arguing that such a significant policy shift required primary legislation and robust public participation.33

The courts halted the rollout, citing the lack of a comprehensive regulatory framework and data protection guarantees. This litigation underscored how the Executive uses regulations to avoid parliamentary scrutiny, relying on the fact that the Committee on Delegated Legislation is often overwhelmed or compliant.

### **6.2 The Senate's Role in Annulling Regulations**

Despite these challenges, the Senate has occasionally exercised its oversight role effectively. In 2025, the Senate annulled the *Environmental Management (Strategic and Integrated Environmental Assessments and Environmental Audits) Regulations*, citing procedural shortcomings and failure to meet statutory thresholds.45 This action was triggered by a petition from the Environment Institute of Kenya, demonstrating the potential of professional bodies to activate legislative checks when they possess the requisite technical literacy.

## ---

**7\. Underutilized Provisions and Remedial Pathways**

Despite the structural challenges, the 2010 Constitution contains dormant or underutilized provisions that offer avenues for redress.

### **7.1 Article 119: The Right to Petition**

Article 119 gives every person the right to petition Parliament to enact, amend, or repeal legislation. This is a direct channel for legislative intervention that bypasses the need for an MP to sponsor a bill. While the mechanism exists, it is underutilized for substantive policy change. Most petitions relate to local grievances rather than national policy.

However, the petition mechanism has potential. The annulment of the Environmental Management Regulations demonstrates that when professional bodies engage technically with Article 119, they can force Parliament to exercise its oversight mandate. This provision remains a sleeping giant for civil society organizations that can marshal technical arguments rather than just political protests.45

### **7.2 Article 35: Access to Information as a Discovery Tool**

Article 35 is frequently cited but rarely used to its full forensic potential in the pre-legislative phase. Litigation has shown that State agencies often hide behind "non-disclosure clauses" in commercial contracts (e.g., SGR contracts). However, the courts have ruled that Article 35 overrides these commercial confidentiality clauses when public interest is at stake.47

Civil society could weaponize Article 35 more effectively by demanding the "raw data" behind Budget Policy Statements *before* they are debated. Currently, engagement happens after the estimates are tabled, leaving little room for analysis. Pre-emptive Article 35 requests could expose the lack of fiscal logic in debt management strategies before they become law. The burden of proof lies with the state to justify non-disclosure, a standard affirmed in *Katiba Institute v Presidents Delivery Unit*.48

### **7.3 Article 258: Enforcement of the Constitution**

Article 258 allows any person to institute proceedings if the Constitution is contravened. This provision has liberalized *locus standi*, allowing public interest litigation (PIL) to flourish. The *Okiya Omtatah* cases are the prime example. However, the potential of Article 258 to challenge *legislative omission* (failure to enact laws) remains largely untested. For example, the failure to enact the *Whistleblower Protection Bill* 49 or the *Public Participation Bill* could be challenged as a violation of the constitutional duty to operationalize rights.

### **7.4 Post-Legislative Scrutiny (PLS)**

The Senate, in collaboration with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD), has begun piloting Post-Legislative Scrutiny (PLS).51 PLS involves reviewing a law after it has been implemented to see if it achieved its objectives. This is a game-changer. Currently, Parliament passes laws and forgets them. PLS creates a feedback loop.

* *Pilot Case:* The Senate Health Committee's PLS inquiry into the *Health Act 2017* revealed significant implementation gaps.52  
* *Opportunity:* Institutionalizing PLS as a Standing Order requirement for *all* major legislation would force the Executive to account for implementation failures and unintended consequences.

**8\. Marginalization, Infrastructure, and Path Dependency**

The vulnerabilities of the Constitution are also evident in how it addresses historical marginalization. The Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) uses formulas to distribute resources, but these formulas often fail to correct deep-seated historical imbalances.

### **8.1 The "White Highlands" Legacy and Path Dependency**

Research indicates that colonial infrastructure investments, particularly the railway and the demarcation of the "White Highlands," created a path dependency that continues to define economic inequality in Kenya. Areas that received early investment in the colonial era continue to attract the bulk of modern infrastructure projects, reinforcing regional disparities.53 The "sunk costs" of colonial infrastructure mean that it is economically cheaper to develop already developed areas, perpetuating the marginalization of the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs).

### **8.2 The Equalisation Fund and Allocation Criteria**

The Equalisation Fund (Article 204\) was designed to address this by providing direct transfers to marginalized areas. However, the CRA's marginalization policy has shifted from targeting counties to targeting specific sub-locations.54 While this ostensibly improves targeting, it also complicates administration and allows for political gerrymandering of "marginalized" units. Critics argue that the fund has been under-disbursed and that the criteria for identification remain contentious, often ignoring the "historical economic advantage" index that would more accurately reflect the disparity between the "White Highlands" and the rest of the country.55

## ---

**9\. Comparative Frameworks and Modernization**

To address the gaps in legislative literacy and oversight, Kenya can draw on Commonwealth best practices and modern technological tools.

### **9.1 The Commonwealth Latimer House Principles**

These principles emphasize the independence of parliamentarians and their ability to function free from executive interference.57 Kenya's Parliament, funding-wise, is independent (via the Parliamentary Service Commission), but politically, it is captured. Adopting the *CPA Benchmarks for Democratic Legislatures* 58 as a formal self-assessment tool—rather than a one-off exercise—could help track the "capture" index over time.

### **9.2 AI and NLP for Legislative Tracking**

The sheer volume of legislation makes manual tracking difficult for civil society. Plural Policy and other AI-driven tools are used in other jurisdictions to track "omnibus bill riders" (non-germane amendments hidden in large bills).59 Developing local NLP (Natural Language Processing) tools to automatically detect:

1. Amendments that deviate significantly from the original bill (detecting "participation washing").  
2. Text reuse from interest group "model bills" (detecting state capture).  
   This would significantly enhance the "literacy" of civil society and independent MPs, leveling the playing field against the Executive.61 Algorithms like Smith-Waterman can be deployed to detect text reuse, identifying where legislation has been copied verbatim from lobby groups or foreign jurisdictions without adaptation to the Kenyan context.63

## ---

**10\. Conclusion: Bridging the Gap**

The 2010 Constitution is a robust document, but its implementation is being stifled by a political elite that has learned to navigate its complexities for self-preservation. The "Imperial Presidency" survives through the capture of Parliament, aided by the "tyranny of numbers" and a deficit in legislative literacy among MPs who sign off on debt anchors and statutory instruments they do not understand.

However, the "underutilized provisions"—Article 35, 119, and 258—combined with new tools like Post-Legislative Scrutiny, offer a pathway for "elite civic literacy" to counter "elite political capture." By shifting focus from general protests to specific, technical engagement with the legislative process (petitions, data requests, regulatory impact assessments), civil society and professional bodies can force the system to align with the constitutional promise.

The solution is not just *better* MPs (degrees), but *better supported* MPs (independent budget offices, research staff) and a more *technically aggressive* civil society that litigates not just the final law, but the procedural omissions (impact assessments, participation feedback) that precede it. The fight for the Constitution has moved from the streets to the details of the PFM Act and the fine print of Statutory Instruments; it is a battle for literacy as much as it is for liberty.
