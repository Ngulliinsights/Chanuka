# **Historical Economic Advantage, Revenue Allocation Models, and Legislative Impact Assessment Frameworks: A Comparative Analysis of Kenya and the Commonwealth**

## **1\. Introduction: The Intersection of History, Law, and Economic Geography**

The governance structures of modern Commonwealth nations are frequently sites of a profound tension between the legacy of colonial administration and the imperatives of contemporary democratic equity. This tension is nowhere more palpable than in the mechanisms of resource allocation and legislative scrutiny. In jurisdictions like Kenya, the spatial distribution of wealth is not merely a product of market forces but a direct consequence of historical decisions—specifically, the "path dependence" established by colonial infrastructure projects such as the Uganda Railway. These historical realities necessitate complex fiscal interventions, such as the Equalisation Fund and the marginalization criteria developed by the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA), to remediate entrenched inequities.

Simultaneously, the modern legislative state requires robust frameworks to ensure that new laws and regulations achieve their intended outcomes without exacerbating these historical fissures. Across the Commonwealth, from the United Kingdom’s Post-Legislative Scrutiny (PLS) to Canada’s Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (RIAS) and South Africa’s Socio-Economic Impact Assessment System (SEIAS), governments have developed sophisticated tools to measure legislative impact. These frameworks range from the purely technocratic—focused on cost-benefit analysis and administrative burden—to the deeply transformative, designed to dismantle legacies of apartheid and colonialism.

This report provides an exhaustive examination of these dynamics. It first quantifies the concept of "historical economic advantage" through the lens of Kenya’s colonial economic geography, analyzing how early infrastructure investments created a "spatial equilibrium" that persists to this day. It then dissects the fiscal mechanisms Kenya has deployed to address this, specifically the CRA’s revenue-sharing formulae and the Equalisation Fund policies. Finally, it triangulates these Kenyan mechanisms against the Legislative Impact Assessment (LIA) frameworks of the UK, Canada, and South Africa, highlighting the gap in Kenya’s own legislative process—particularly regarding public participation—and offering a synthesis of how these global best practices can inform the pursuit of distributive justice.

## **2\. Theoretical Frameworks: Colonial Origins and Path Dependence**

To understand the contemporary debates regarding revenue allocation in Kenya, one must first engage with the theoretical literature on the "colonial origins of comparative development." This body of scholarship, spearheaded by economists such as Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson, posits that the economic performance of modern states is fundamentally determined by the institutional and infrastructural choices made during the colonial era.1

### **2.1 The Settler Mortality Hypothesis and Institutional Formation**

The foundational theory suggests a bifurcation in colonization strategies based on the feasibility of European settlement. In regions where the disease environment was favorable and "settler mortality" was low, colonial powers established "Neo-Europes"—settler colonies characterized by institutions of private property, checks and balances, and infrastructure designed to support long-term economic activity.1 Conversely, in regions with high mortality rates, the strategy was "extractive," creating institutions designed solely to transfer resources to the metropole with minimal investment in local development.2

Kenya occupies a complex position within this dichotomy. While parts of the country (the "White Highlands") were designated for settlement, creating pockets of inclusive institutions and high investment, the remainder of the territory was treated as a labor reserve or a buffer zone, subjected to extractive or neglectful governance.4 This duality created a fragmented institutional landscape where high-potential areas were integrated into the global economy while others were systematically marginalized—a fissure that defines the politics of revenue allocation today.

### **2.2 Path Dependence and Spatial Equilibrium**

The persistence of these historical patterns is explained by the economic theory of "path dependence." This theory suggests that initial conditions—such as the placement of a railway station or the location of a colonial administrative center—can "lock in" economic activity for decades or centuries, even after the original reasons for those locations have vanished.6

In the context of economic geography, this "lock-in" is driven by two primary forces:

1. **Sunk Costs:** Once massive investments in physical infrastructure (railways, roads, hospitals) are made, they are immovable. Economic agents (firms, workers) naturally cluster around these assets to minimize costs.6  
2. **Coordination Failures:** Even if a new location might theoretically be more efficient, no single firm will move there unless others do. This collective action problem ensures that economic activity remains "stuck" in the centers established by historical accidents or colonial fiat.8

Understanding these theoretical underpinnings is crucial for evaluating Kenya’s current revenue allocation criteria. When the CRA allocates funds based on "health" or "urban services," it is effectively measuring variables that were determined by these colonial interventions a century ago.

## **3\. The Kenyan Context: The "Lunatic Express" and the Geography of Inequality**

The "historical economic advantage index" in Kenya is not an abstract concept; it is a tangible reality etched into the landscape by the "Lunatic Express"—the colonial railway constructed between 1896 and 1901 connecting Mombasa to Kisumu.5 This infrastructure project serves as the primary explanatory variable for the regional disparities that the CRA seeks to address today.

### **3.1 The Exogenous Shock of the Railway**

Research by Jedwab, Kerby, and Moradi (2017) provides a rigorous quantitative analysis of the railway's impact. Unlike infrastructure in developed nations, which often connected existing population centers, the Kenya-Uganda railway was built for geostrategic reasons—to secure the headwaters of the Nile and facilitate control over the interior.7 It traversed sparsely populated regions, effectively creating an "exogenous shock" to the economic geography of the territory.6

The impact was immediate and profound. European settlers, incentivized by the colonial administration, clustered along the rail line. The "White Highlands"—regions like Nakuru, Uasin Gishu, and Kiambu—became the epicenter of commercial agriculture and urbanization.5 This was not merely a matter of convenience; it was codified in law through the Crown Lands Ordinance, which restricted land ownership in these prime areas to Europeans, while indigenous populations were relegated to "Native Reserves" often located far from the infrastructural spine.4

### **3.2 The Persistence of "Railroad Cities"**

One might assume that after independence in 1963, and the subsequent departure of many European settlers, the economic geography of Kenya would revert to a pre-colonial equilibrium or shift toward indigenous population centers. However, the empirical evidence demonstrates the opposite. The "railroad cities"—towns like Nairobi, Nakuru, and Kisumu that emerged solely because of the line—have persisted as the dominant economic hubs.9

Jedwab and Moradi’s analysis of fine spatial data over one century shows a strong causal link: the colonial railroad determined the location of European settlers, which in turn determined the location of schools, hospitals, and roads. Even though the railway itself declined in importance with the rise of road transport, the "agglomeration economies" (the benefits firms derive from being near each other) ensured that these centers continued to grow.6

This persistence has created a stark "Historical Economic Advantage Index." A child born in a county along the "colonial spine" today has significantly better access to education, healthcare, and electricity than a child born in the historically marginalized Northern Frontier Districts (now the ASAL counties), not because of modern policy success, but because of the enduring legacy of colonial sunk investments.8

### **3.3 Comparative Perspectives: The African Experience**

This phenomenon is not unique to Kenya. In Ghana, colonial railroads built to transport cocoa and minerals similarly defined the spatial distribution of cities, with effects persisting long after the specific export commodities shifted.1 In South Africa, the railway network connecting ports to the diamond and gold mines explained a significant portion of the Cape Colony's growth in the late 19th century, while non-connected areas faced relative economic decline.8

However, the Kenyan case is particularly acute due to the specific legal mechanisms of the "Closed Districts." The Northern Frontier District (encompassing present-day Turkana, Marsabit, Mandera, Wajir) was essentially sealed off from the rest of the colony. Movement was restricted, and investment was virtually non-existent.11 This created a "dual economy" that devolution in 2010 sought to dismantle—a task that requires not just equal funding, but "equalisation" funding to overcome a century of accumulated disadvantage.

## **4\. Fiscal Mechanisms for Redress: The Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA)**

The 2010 Constitution of Kenya was a direct response to the "nature-based" and "policy-based" marginalization described above.12 It established a devolved system of government with 47 counties and created the Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) to oversee the equitable sharing of national revenue. The CRA’s mandate is twofold: to recommend a basis for sharing revenue generally (Article 216\) and to define "marginalized areas" for the specific application of the Equalisation Fund (Article 204).14

### **4.1 The Evolution of Revenue Sharing Formulae**

The allocation of the "equitable share" of revenue among counties is governed by a formula approved by Parliament every five years. The evolution of this formula reflects the intense political struggle between "historical advantage" (represented by population and urban parameters) and "historical marginalization" (represented by land area and poverty parameters).

#### **The Third Basis Formula (2020-2025)**

The current formula, known as the "Third Basis," represents a sophisticated attempt to balance these competing interests. Unlike previous iterations, it introduced a wider array of indices to capture the cost of service delivery more accurately.

Table 1: The Third Basis for Revenue Allocation 15

| Indicator of Expenditure Need | Assigned Weight | Justification |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Population** | 18% | Primary driver of service demand. "Money follows people." |
| **Health Index** | 17% | Based on facility gaps and primary health care visits. |
| **Agriculture Index** | 10% | Supports food security; based on food-poor households. |
| **Urban Services Index** | 5% | Costs of lighting, waste management, and urban planning. |
| **Roads Index** | 8% | Maintenance of access roads; heavily favors vast counties. |
| **Poverty Index** | 14% | Affirmative action for deprivation. |
| **Land Area** | 8% | Administrative costs of governing large territories. |
| **Basic Share** | 20% | Equal share for all counties to run administration. |

The approval of this formula was highly contentious. Senators from marginalized counties (the "Team Kenya" faction) argued that the heavy weighting on population (18%) and functional indices like Health (17%) and Urban Services (5%) penalized them. Their argument was rooted in historical causality: they lack health facilities and urban centers *precisely because* of historical neglect.16 Therefore, a formula that allocates money based on the *existence* of these facilities (or the population attracted to them) reinforces the colonial status quo.

To resolve the impasse, a "protection mechanism" was introduced: the formula applies to revenue *above* a baseline of Ksh 158.25 billion (half of the 2019/20 allocation). This ensures that no county loses revenue in absolute terms compared to the previous year, cushioning the "losers" of the new formula.15

### **4.2 The Equalisation Fund: Institutionalizing Affirmative Action**

While the equitable share formula addresses recurrent expenditure, the **Equalisation Fund** (Article 204\) is the specific constitutional instrument for addressing historical marginalization. It is financed by 0.5% of all revenue collected by the national government and has a strict sunset clause of 20 years (ending in 2030).14

The Fund is restricted to providing basic services: water, roads, health facilities, and electricity. Its explicit goal is to bring the quality of these services in marginalized areas to the level generally enjoyed by the rest of the nation.14

#### **The First Policy (2013-2017): The "County" Approach**

The CRA’s First Policy identified marginalized areas at the *county* level. Using the County Development Index (CDI) and historical analysis, it designated 14 counties as marginalized: Turkana, Mandera, Wajir, Marsabit, Samburu, West Pokot, Tana River, Narok, Kwale, Garissa, Kilifi, Taita Taveta, Isiolo, and Lamu.14

This approach was criticized for being too broad. It ignored pockets of poverty in "prosperous" counties and pockets of wealth in "marginalized" counties. For example, the urban center of Malindi in Kilifi (a marginalized county) is relatively well-serviced, while parts of Nyeri (a "prosperous" county) face significant deprivation.19

#### **The Second Policy (2018): The "Sub-Location" Approach**

In response to these critiques, the CRA’s Second Policy revolutionized the identification criteria. It shifted the unit of analysis from the county to the **sub-location**—the lowest administrative unit in Kenya.

Using data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), the CRA constructed a deprivation index based on access to safe water, sanitation, and electricity. It then identified **1,424 specific sub-locations** across 34 counties that fell into the bottom quartiles of deprivation.11 This nuanced approach acknowledged that "marginalization" is not just a regional phenomenon but a local one, often hidden within aggregate statistics.

It notably included minority groups previously overlooked, such as the Elmolo, Makonde, Waata, and Dorobo-Salieta, recognizing their specific historical exclusion.11

### **4.3 Challenges of Implementation**

Despite these sophisticated identification mechanisms, the impact of the Equalisation Fund has been stymied by bureaucratic lethargy. The **Equalisation Fund Advisory Board**, established to administer the fund, has faced criticism for slow disbursement.17 By 2019, billions of shillings remained unspent.

Furthermore, the "sunset clause" (2030) is rapidly approaching. Critics argue that the 20-year timeline was optimistic, assuming that a century of colonial and post-colonial neglect could be reversed in two decades. The assumption that parity would be achieved by 2030 is now viewed by many analysts as "wildly fallacious," given the scale of the infrastructure gap in the ASALs.16

## **5\. Comparative Legislative Impact Assessment (LIA) Frameworks**

While Kenya has focused heavily on *fiscal* mechanisms for redress, other Commonwealth nations have developed advanced *procedural* frameworks to assess the impact of legislation. These frameworks—Legislative Impact Assessment (LIA)—ensure that laws are evidence-based, efficient, and socially equitable. Comparing Kenya’s approach to Canada, the UK, and South Africa highlights significant gaps in the Kenyan legislative process.

### **5.1 Canada: The Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (RIAS)**

Canada operates one of the most rigorous *ex-ante* (pre-enactment) impact assessment systems in the world. This system is governed by the **Cabinet Directive on Regulation (CDR)**, which mandates that every regulatory proposal be accompanied by a **Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (RIAS)**.20

#### **The Architecture of RIAS**

The RIAS is a public document published in the *Canada Gazette*, ensuring transparency and accountability. Its structure is strictly prescribed:

1. **Problem Identification:** The regulator must clearly articulate the problem and why government intervention is necessary. This prevents "regulation for regulation's sake".21  
2. **Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA):** For any proposal with "significant costs" (defined as greater than $1 million per year), a quantitative CBA is mandatory.22 This includes the "One-for-One Rule" (for every new administrative burden imposed, one must be removed) and the "Small Business Lens" (analyzing impacts on small enterprises).23  
3. **Gender-Based Analysis Plus (GBA+):** This is a distinct feature of the Canadian model. GBA+ requires regulators to assess how policies affect diverse groups based on gender, race, indigenous status, and other identity factors.21 This moves the RIAS beyond pure economics into the realm of social equity.  
4. **Consultation Summary:** The RIAS must detail who was consulted, what they said, and—crucially—how the department *responded* to those views.24 This "closing the loop" is a key differentiator from the Kenyan model.

#### **The Role of Evidence**

The Canadian system places a premium on evidence. Departments are required to use valid data to support their claims. For example, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) publishes its full CBA reports for transparency.22 The system effectively forces legislative drafters to "show their work" before a law can be passed.

### **5.2 The United Kingdom: Post-Legislative Scrutiny (PLS)**

While Canada focuses on *ex-ante* analysis, the United Kingdom has pioneered **Post-Legislative Scrutiny (PLS)**. This framework acknowledges that the actual impact of a law is often different from what was predicted. PLS is the process of reviewing the implementation and impact of legislation after it has been in force for a certain period.25

#### **The Mechanism of Scrutiny**

The UK model is driven by Parliamentary Select Committees and the Law Commission. The standard process involves:

* **The Memorandum:** Government departments are typically required to submit a memorandum to the relevant committee 3 to 5 years after an Act receives Royal Assent.27 This document details the Act's implementation status, legal challenges, and preliminary impact.  
* **The Inquiry:** Based on the memorandum, the committee may launch a full inquiry, calling witnesses and gathering evidence to determine if the law is working.28

#### **WFD Checklists and Best Practices**

The Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD) has codified the PLS process into a global standard. Their "Manual on Post-Legislative Scrutiny" provides detailed checklists for parliaments.29

Table 2: Key Steps in WFD Post-Legislative Scrutiny 29

| Phase | Key Actions |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Preparation** | Define objectives and scope; Collect background information; Identify stakeholders. |
| **Implementation** | Review delegated legislation; Conduct public hearings; Analyze findings against objectives. |
| **Follow-Up** | Draft report with recommendations; Seek government response; Monitor policy adjustments. |

This systematic approach ensures that legislation is treated as a cycle, not a one-off event. It allows for the correction of errors and the adjustment of laws that produce unintended consequences.25

### **5.3 South Africa: Socio-Economic Impact Assessment System (SEIAS)**

South Africa’s **Socio-Economic Impact Assessment System (SEIAS)** is perhaps the most relevant comparator for Kenya. Like Kenya, South Africa is grappling with the legacy of a dual economy and spatial segregation. Consequently, SEIAS is not just about "efficiency"; it is an instrument of **transformation**.30

#### **Phase 1 and Phase 2 Assessments**

Managed by the Department of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME), SEIAS involves two distinct phases:

1. **Initial Impact Assessment (Phase 1):** Conducted at the inception of policy development. It asks fundamental questions: Is a new law actually needed? What are the root causes of the problem?.31  
2. **Final Impact Assessment (Phase 2):** Submitted to Cabinet with the final bill. This is a comprehensive document that must quantify costs and benefits.31

#### **Root Causes and National Priorities**

The SEIAS templates differ significantly from the Canadian RIAS by focusing on structural issues.

* **Root Cause Analysis:** Departments must identify the deep structural causes of the problem, preventing superficial policy fixes.32  
* **Distributional Impact:** The template explicitly asks: *Who benefits and who loses?* It mandates an assessment of impacts on the **poorest households** (earning \<R7000/month), **Black people**, **women**, **youth**, and **rural areas**.32  
* **Spatial Integration:** Reflecting the apartheid legacy, SEIAS requires an assessment of how the proposal affects settlement patterns and spatial justice.33

This framework forces legislative drafters to confront the "historical economic advantage" of certain groups and regions directly. A bill that is economically efficient but exacerbates inequality would theoretically be flagged and revised under the SEIAS system.

## **6\. The Kenyan Legislative Gap: Public Participation and the Search for Frameworks**

Compared to the rigorous frameworks of Canada (RIAS), the UK (PLS), and South Africa (SEIAS), Kenya’s system for assessing legislative impact is nascent. It relies primarily on the constitutional principle of **Public Participation** (Article 10 and 118\) and the oversight of the Judiciary.

### **6.1 The Constitutional Mandate and Judicial Intervention**

The 2010 Constitution revolutionized the legislative process by making public participation a mandatory requirement for the validity of any law. Article 118 requires Parliament to "facilitate public participation," and Article 10 lists "participation of the people" as a national value.34

The Kenyan Judiciary has been instrumental in enforcing this. In a series of landmark rulings, courts have struck down legislation—including the *Finance Act 2023* and various county laws—for failure to conduct "meaningful" participation.

* **Katiba Institute Cases:** In *Katiba Institute v Presidents Delivery Unit*, the court linked access to information directly to participation, ruling that citizens cannot participate meaningfully if the government operates in secrecy.36  
* **Thresholds of Participation:** The courts have established that participation cannot be a mere "public relations exercise." It requires:  
  1. **Adequate Notice:** Citizens must be given sufficient time to prepare.  
  2. **Access to Information:** The bill and relevant data must be accessible.  
  3. **Feedback Mechanism:** The legislature must demonstrate that it considered the public's views, even if it did not adopt them.35

### **6.2 The Struggle for a Statutory Framework: The Public Participation Bills**

Despite judicial activism, there is no single Act of Parliament that operationalizes public participation. This has led to inconsistency and "tick-box" exercises. Several attempts to pass a **Public Participation Bill** have stalled.

#### **The Public Participation Bill 2018 (Senate Bill No. 4\)**

This bill attempted to standardize the process. It proposed a "Registrar of Public Participation" to oversee the process and set timelines. However, civil society groups like the **Institute for Social Accountability (TISA)** criticized it for weak timelines. TISA advocated for a minimum **14-day notice** period (up from the proposed 7\) and mandatory publication in two newspapers of national circulation.38

#### **The Public Participation Bill 2024**

The most recent iteration, the Public Participation Bill 2024, seeks to cure the defects of previous attempts. It emphasizes:

* **Guiding Principles:** That the public has a *right* to be consulted and involved in decision-making.39  
* **Inclusion:** It mandates specific measures to include marginalized groups, aligning with the "historical redress" ethos.40  
* **Feedback Loops:** It attempts to codify the judicial requirement that Parliament must provide feedback to stakeholders on why their views were accepted or rejected.40

Civil society analysis by **Mzalendo Trust** and **KICTANet** highlights that while the 2024 Bill is an improvement, it still lacks the bite of a system like SEIAS. They argue for "deliberative democracy"—deeper engagement methods beyond simple town halls—and stronger enforcement mechanisms.40

### **6.3 "Decisions Made in Silence": The Trust Deficit**

The absence of a formalized LIA framework like SEIAS or RIAS has real-world consequences. Mzalendo Trust notes that while the CRA formula attracts attention, critical decisions on **public debt**—which consumes over 60% of national revenue—are often made "in silence" by parliamentary committees with minimal public scrutiny.42

This "silent decision-making" creates a trust deficit. The massive protests in 2024, driven by "Gen Z," were a direct reaction to a legislative process that was perceived as unresponsive. The slogan "You do not listen to us" reflects a failure of the current framework to translate participation into impact.41 Without a system that *forces* the government to document costs, benefits, and stakeholder views (like the RIAS), the public feels disconnected from the laws that govern them.

## **7\. Synthesis and Strategic Implications**

Comparing the Kenyan experience with the Commonwealth examples reveals distinct models of managing the intersection of history, economy, and law.

### **7.1 The "Redress" Model vs. The "Efficiency" Model**

* **Kenya and South Africa** operate under a **"Redress Model."** Both nations explicitly acknowledge that the "neutral" application of law will reproduce historical inequality due to path dependence.  
  * *Kenya* focuses on **Fiscal Redress** via the CRA and Equalisation Fund.  
  * *South Africa* focuses on **Legislative Redress** via SEIAS, ensuring every law contributes to transformation.  
* **Canada and the UK** operate closer to an **"Efficiency Model."** While Canada’s GBA+ is moving toward equity, the primary focus of RIAS and PLS remains the technical quality of legislation and the minimization of economic burden.

### **7.2 The Missing Link: Spatial Impact Assessment**

Kenya’s CRA policies have successfully identified *where* the marginalized are (the 1,424 sub-locations). However, Kenya lacks a mechanism to ensure that *non-fiscal* legislation (e.g., a Trade Bill or an Energy Bill) supports these areas.

* **The Gap:** A Trade Bill might be economically efficient nationally (GDP growth) but disastrous for the pastoralist economy in Wajir (spatial inequality).  
* **The Solution:** Kenya needs to borrow the **"Spatial Integration"** metric from South Africa’s SEIAS.33 Every bill presented to the Kenyan Parliament should be required to answer: *How does this legislation impact the 1,424 marginalized sub-locations identified by the CRA?*

### **7.3 Institutionalizing Scrutiny**

Currently, Kenya’s legislative scrutiny is reactive (court cases) rather than proactive. Adopting a **Post-Legislative Scrutiny (PLS)** mechanism similar to the UK would be transformative.

* Instead of waiting for the CRA to complain about absorption rates, a Parliamentary Select Committee should legally require the Treasury to submit a memorandum 3 years after a budget vote, detailing exactly how the funds impacted the "Health Index" or "Roads Index" in marginalized counties.

## **8\. Conclusion**

The economic geography of Kenya remains tethered to the steel rails laid in 1901\. This "historical economic advantage" is not a relic of the past but a living variable in the revenue allocation equations of the present. The "railroad cities" continue to accumulate capital through agglomeration economies, while the "closed districts" struggle to catch up.6

While the Commission on Revenue Allocation and the Equalisation Fund represent bold constitutional attempts to correct these imbalances, their success is constrained by the lack of a comprehensive Legislative Impact Assessment framework. The current reliance on "Public Participation" is necessary but insufficient; it is a process without a structured output.

By examining the Commonwealth comparators, a clear path forward emerges. Kenya requires a fusion of these approaches:

1. **From South Africa:** Adopt the "Root Cause" and "Spatial Integration" assessment templates to ensure all laws tackle the colonial legacy.  
2. **From Canada:** Adopt the mandatory "Consultation Summary" and "Gender-Based Analysis" to ensure transparency and inclusivity.  
3. **From the UK:** Institutionalize "Post-Legislative Scrutiny" to continuously monitor whether the "Equalisation" is actually happening.

Only by integrating these rigorous impact assessment frameworks can Kenya move from merely *allocating* revenue for redress to *legislating* for genuine transformation, finally redirecting the "Lunatic Express" toward a destination of equitable development.
