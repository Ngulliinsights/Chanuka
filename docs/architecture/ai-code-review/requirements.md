# Requirements Document: AI-Generated Code Review Framework
## Project Overview

**Project Name:** AI-Generated Code Review Framework  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Purpose:** Establish structured review processes for code that may have been generated or assisted by AI tools, addressing the specific failure modes and risk patterns these tools introduce.

## Executive Summary

This requirements document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for implementing a comprehensive code review framework specifically designed to catch issues characteristic of AI-generated code. The framework addresses teams who have already integrated AI coding assistants into their workflow and are now experiencing the downstream effects of insufficient scrutiny. These requirements are structured using the EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) pattern to ensure each requirement is testable, unambiguous, and traceable to implementation tasks.

The framework must balance thoroughness with practicality, providing sufficient scrutiny to catch AI-specific issues without creating review bottlenecks that halt development velocity. Requirements are organized into five functional domains corresponding to our strategic personas: Security Validation, Code Quality Assessment, Testing Verification, Production Readiness, and Process Integration.

## FR-001: Surface-Level Verification Requirements

### User Story
As a code reviewer examining potentially AI-generated code, I want automated and manual checks that verify basic correctness and existence of referenced entities, so that I can catch obvious AI hallucinations before investing time in deeper analysis.

### Acceptance Criteria

**AC-001.1: Dependency Verification**  
WHEN a code submission includes import or require statements THEN the system SHALL verify that every imported module, package, or library exists in the project dependencies or standard library WHERE verification occurs against the actual dependency manifest (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, etc.) and produces a report listing any non-existent dependencies with their locations in the code.

**AC-001.2: API Method Validation**  
WHEN code calls methods on external libraries or frameworks THEN the reviewer SHALL cross-reference at least three method calls per external dependency against official documentation WHERE verification confirms the method exists, accepts the provided arguments, and returns the expected type, with discrepancies flagged for manual investigation.

**AC-001.3: Type Safety Assessment**  
WHEN examining code in statically-typed languages or typed variants THEN the system SHALL identify all uses of escape-hatch types (any, object, dynamic, etc.) WHERE each instance is marked for review justification and the ratio of escaped types to total type annotations does not exceed ten percent without explicit architectural approval.

**AC-001.4: Configuration Validation**  
WHEN code references configuration values, environment variables, or feature flags THEN the reviewer SHALL verify these values are defined in the project's configuration management system WHERE missing configurations are documented and either added to configuration templates or removed from code as unused references.

**AC-001.5: Error Message Security Review**  
WHEN examining error handling code THEN the reviewer SHALL identify all error messages, log statements, and exception details that might be exposed to users or external systems WHERE messages containing file paths, database schemas, query structures, stack traces, or internal architecture details are flagged as information leakage risks requiring remediation.

**AC-001.6: Test Execution Verification**  
WHEN automated tests accompany implementation code THEN the review process SHALL execute all tests in isolation and verify they pass consistently across at least three consecutive runs WHERE any test showing intermittent failures or environmental dependencies is marked as unreliable and requiring refactoring before merge approval.

## FR-002: Logic and Correctness Requirements

### User Story
As a technical lead reviewing code functionality, I want systematic verification of edge cases and boundary conditions, so that I can ensure code works correctly beyond the happy path scenarios that AI tools optimize for.

### Acceptance Criteria

**AC-002.1: Edge Case Documentation**  
WHEN reviewing any function or method that processes input data THEN the reviewer SHALL document at least five relevant edge cases (empty inputs, null values, boundary values, invalid formats, unexpected types) WHERE each edge case is either covered by existing tests or added to the test suite before approval.

**AC-002.2: Boundary Condition Verification**  
WHEN code includes loops, array access, or range operations THEN the reviewer SHALL manually trace execution for minimum boundary (first element, zero, empty), maximum boundary (last element, upper limit), and off-by-one scenarios WHERE any boundary that could cause index errors, infinite loops, or incorrect results requires code modification and test coverage.

**AC-002.3: Null Safety Analysis**  
WHEN examining code that dereferences objects or accesses properties THEN the system SHALL identify all dereference operations and verify null/undefined checks exist upstream WHERE missing null checks in code paths that could receive null values must be added with appropriate error handling or default value logic.

**AC-002.4: Mathematical Operation Accuracy**  
WHEN code performs calculations involving currency, percentages, floating-point arithmetic, or precision-sensitive operations THEN the reviewer SHALL verify appropriate numeric types are used (Decimal for currency, not float) and formulas are mathematically correct WHERE verification includes manual calculation of at least three test cases with known correct results.

**AC-002.5: Conditional Logic Completeness**  
WHEN reviewing branching logic including if-else chains, switch statements, or pattern matching THEN the reviewer SHALL verify all possible input cases are handled and terminal branches include either appropriate default handling or explicit error raising WHERE unhandled cases that could occur in production require either handling logic or justified documentation of why they cannot occur.

**AC-002.6: State Management Consistency**  
WHEN code manages mutable state across multiple operations THEN the reviewer SHALL trace state transitions and verify invariants are maintained WHERE any sequence of operations that could leave the system in an inconsistent state requires either synchronization mechanisms, transactional boundaries, or architectural refactoring.

## FR-003: Security and Robustness Requirements

### User Story
As a security architect protecting production systems, I want systematic detection of vulnerability patterns that AI tools commonly introduce, so that I can prevent security issues before they reach production.

### Acceptance Criteria

**AC-003.1: Input Validation Enforcement**  
WHEN external data enters the system through any interface (HTTP requests, file uploads, API responses, user input, message queues) THEN the system SHALL verify validation exists at the entry point WHERE validation checks data type, format, range, and business rules before use, with validation failures resulting in safe error responses that do not expose internal details.

**AC-003.2: SQL Injection Prevention**  
WHEN code constructs database queries THEN the reviewer SHALL verify one hundred percent of queries use parameterized statements or ORM methods that prevent injection WHERE any string concatenation or template interpolation in query construction is rejected unless the developer provides written justification reviewed by a security specialist.

**AC-003.3: Authentication Verification**  
WHEN code implements endpoints, operations, or data access that should be restricted THEN the reviewer SHALL verify authentication checks exist and execute before business logic WHERE authentication must verify user identity through the project's established authentication mechanism, not custom token handling or session management unless architecturally justified.

**AC-003.4: Authorization Enforcement**  
WHEN authenticated operations access or modify resources THEN the code SHALL verify the user has specific permission for that resource and operation WHERE authorization checks occur immediately before access, use the project's authorization system consistently, and fail securely by denying access rather than allowing it when verification fails.

**AC-003.5: Secrets Management Compliance**  
WHEN reviewing code changes THEN the system SHALL scan for hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens, passwords, encryption keys, or connection strings WHERE any discovered secrets require immediate removal, rotation of the exposed credential, and verification that proper secret management (environment variables, secret manager, encrypted configuration) is implemented.

**AC-003.6: Cryptographic Operation Safety**  
WHEN code performs encryption, hashing, random number generation for security purposes, or other cryptographic operations THEN the reviewer SHALL verify use of vetted libraries (not custom implementations), cryptographically-secure random sources (not Math.random equivalents), appropriate algorithms for the use case, and correct key management WHERE any custom cryptography or use of deprecated algorithms requires security architect approval.

## FR-004: Resource Management and Production Readiness Requirements

### User Story
As a DevOps specialist ensuring operational stability, I want verification that code properly manages resources and handles production scenarios, so that development-tested code doesn't create problems under production load or failure conditions.

### Acceptance Criteria

**AC-004.1: Resource Cleanup Verification**  
WHEN code opens connections, files, streams, or other system resources THEN the reviewer SHALL verify cleanup occurs in all code paths including error conditions WHERE cleanup uses appropriate language mechanisms (try-finally, context managers, using statements, defer) and resources cannot leak even when exceptions occur.

**AC-004.2: Error Recovery Strategy**  
WHEN code can fail due to external dependencies (network, database, file system, third-party APIs) THEN the implementation SHALL include appropriate error handling WHERE errors are caught at the right abstraction level, logged with sufficient context for debugging without exposing secrets, and either recovered from with retries and fallbacks or propagated to callers who can handle them.

**AC-004.3: Timeout and Deadline Management**  
WHEN code makes external calls to databases, APIs, or services THEN every operation SHALL have explicit timeouts preventing indefinite blocking WHERE timeout values are configurable, appropriate for the operation type, and timeout failures are handled gracefully with clear error messages.

**AC-004.4: Observability Implementation**  
WHEN reviewing new functionality THEN the code SHALL include structured logging at appropriate levels (errors for failures, info for significant operations, debug for troubleshooting details) and metrics for key operations WHERE logs include correlation IDs for request tracing and metrics track success rates, latency, and error patterns.

**AC-004.5: Scalability Consideration**  
WHEN code processes collections, batch operations, or data that could grow large THEN the reviewer SHALL verify the implementation handles growth gracefully WHERE operations use pagination or streaming for large datasets, avoid loading entire collections into memory, and include safeguards against resource exhaustion.

**AC-004.6: Concurrency Safety Assessment**  
WHEN code accesses shared state from multiple threads, processes, or async contexts THEN the reviewer SHALL verify appropriate synchronization mechanisms exist WHERE race conditions are prevented through locks, atomic operations, or immutable data structures, and potential deadlocks are architecturally avoided.

## FR-005: Maintainability and Code Quality Requirements

### User Story
As a technical lead responsible for long-term codebase health, I want verification that code will remain understandable and modifiable over time, so that we don't accumulate technical debt that slows future development.

### Acceptance Criteria

**AC-005.1: Code Complexity Management**  
WHEN reviewing functions or methods THEN the system SHALL measure cyclomatic complexity and cognitive complexity WHERE functions exceeding complexity threshold (15 for cyclomatic, 10 for cognitive) require either refactoring into smaller functions or explicit justification that the complexity is essential to the problem domain.

**AC-005.2: Naming Convention Consistency**  
WHEN examining variable, function, class, and module names THEN the reviewer SHALL verify adherence to project naming conventions WHERE names are descriptive of purpose (not generic like data, temp, result), use consistent terminology across the codebase, and avoid abbreviations that aren't universally understood in the domain.

**AC-005.3: Documentation Appropriateness**  
WHEN reviewing comments and documentation THEN the reviewer SHALL verify comments explain non-obvious decisions and business logic rather than restating code WHERE missing comments on complex algorithms, surprising implementation choices, or business rule implementations require addition, while obvious comments that merely restate code require removal as noise.

**AC-005.4: Abstraction Justification**  
WHEN code introduces new abstractions (interfaces, base classes, generic types, factory patterns, dependency injection containers) THEN the reviewer SHALL verify the abstraction solves an actual complexity problem WHERE abstractions must provide clear value through enabling testing, managing variation, or simplifying client code, and unnecessary abstraction layers are removed in favor of direct implementations.

**AC-005.5: Pattern Consistency Verification**  
WHEN reviewing implementation approaches THEN the reviewer SHALL verify consistency with established project patterns for error handling, logging, data access, API design, and state management WHERE deviations from project conventions require explicit justification and architectural discussion rather than being accepted simply because the code works.

**AC-005.6: Dependency Appropriateness**  
WHEN code introduces new external dependencies THEN the reviewer SHALL verify the dependency is actively maintained, properly licensed, appropriate for the use case, and provides value that justifies the maintenance burden WHERE heavy dependencies for simple tasks or deprecated libraries require either finding lighter alternatives or implementing the functionality directly.

## FR-006: Testing Strategy Requirements

### User Story
As a QA engineer ensuring code quality, I want tests that provide real verification of behavior rather than superficial coverage, so that we catch regressions and build confidence in our ability to modify code safely.

### Acceptance Criteria

**AC-006.1: Test Coverage Meaningfulness**  
WHEN examining test suites THEN the reviewer SHALL verify tests cover both happy paths and failure scenarios WHERE each public function or API endpoint has tests for at least one success case, one invalid input case, and one error condition case, with coverage measuring behavioral verification not just line execution.

**AC-006.2: Test Independence Verification**  
WHEN running automated tests THEN each test SHALL execute independently without requiring specific ordering or shared state WHERE tests can run in any order, in parallel, or in isolation and produce the same results, with test failures caused by ordering indicating test design problems requiring refactoring.

**AC-006.3: Assertion Specificity**  
WHEN reviewing test assertions THEN the reviewer SHALL verify assertions check specific expected behavior rather than just verifying code executes WHERE assertions verify actual values against expected values, check error types and messages, and validate state changes, rather than just confirming methods return successfully.

**AC-006.4: Test Data Appropriateness**  
WHEN tests use example data THEN the reviewer SHALL verify test data includes representative edge cases and realistic scenarios WHERE test data covers boundary values, empty cases, maximum sizes, and special characters rather than only simple happy-path values, and sensitive or production data is never used in tests.

**AC-006.5: Integration Test Coverage**  
WHEN reviewing systems with external dependencies THEN the test suite SHALL include integration tests that verify correct interaction with databases, APIs, and services WHERE integration tests use test instances or mocks that accurately represent actual dependency behavior, and critical integration points are tested before production deployment.

**AC-006.6: Performance Baseline Testing**  
WHEN implementing functionality with performance requirements THEN the test suite SHALL include performance tests that verify response time, throughput, or resource usage WHERE performance tests establish baselines and fail if degradation exceeds defined thresholds, preventing performance regressions from reaching production.

## FR-007: Process Integration Requirements

### User Story
As an engineering manager implementing this framework, I want processes that integrate smoothly with existing workflows and scale with team size, so that enhanced scrutiny becomes sustainable practice rather than temporary overhead.

### Acceptance Criteria

**AC-007.1: Review Checklist Accessibility**  
WHEN developers prepare code for review THEN they SHALL have access to a structured checklist covering all framework verification points WHERE the checklist is available in the pull request template, integrated into the code review tool, and organized by review layer for systematic application.

**AC-007.2: AI Usage Disclosure**  
WHEN submitting code for review THEN the developer SHALL disclose whether AI tools were used in generating or modifying the code WHERE disclosure indicates which tool was used and the extent of AI assistance (full generation, completion suggestions, refactoring, etc.), enabling reviewers to apply appropriate scrutiny levels.

**AC-007.3: Automated Check Integration**  
WHEN code is submitted for review THEN automated systems SHALL execute static analysis, security scanning, and linting checks WHERE automated checks run on every pull request before human review, produce actionable reports with specific file and line references, and block merge for critical violations.

**AC-007.4: High-Risk Code Designation**  
WHEN code touches authentication, authorization, payment processing, personal data handling, or security-critical operations THEN the review process SHALL require enhanced scrutiny WHERE high-risk changes require multiple reviewer approval, security specialist review, and cannot bypass review through administrative override.

**AC-007.5: Review Feedback Documentation**  
WHEN reviews identify AI-generated issues THEN the findings SHALL be documented in a shared knowledge base WHERE documentation describes the issue pattern, how it was detected, the fix that was applied, and guidance for detecting similar issues in future reviews, building institutional knowledge over time.

**AC-007.6: Retrospective Analysis**  
WHEN production issues occur that were not caught in review THEN the team SHALL conduct retrospective analysis WHERE the analysis determines whether the issue would have been caught by this framework, identifies gaps in the review process, and updates review procedures or automated checks to catch similar issues in future.

## NFR-001: Performance and Efficiency Requirements

### Non-Functional Requirement
The review framework must enhance code quality without creating unsustainable bottlenecks in the development workflow.

**NFR-001.1:** Review time for standard pull requests shall not increase by more than fifty percent compared to pre-framework baseline, measured over a four-week rolling average.

**NFR-001.2:** Automated checks shall complete within five minutes for ninety-five percent of pull requests, with results available before human reviewers begin examination.

**NFR-001.3:** Review checklist completion shall require no more than fifteen minutes for changes under two hundred lines, scaling linearly with change size.

---

## NFR-002: Adoption and Usability Requirements

### Non-Functional Requirement
The framework must be learnable and adoptable by development teams with varying levels of AI tool experience.

**NFR-002.1:** New team members shall be able to apply the framework effectively after completing a two-hour training session and reviewing three example pull requests with documented review findings.

**NFR-002.2:** Review documentation shall provide clear examples of both problematic patterns and correct alternatives for each category of issue the framework targets.

**NFR-002.3:** Framework guidance shall be available inline in the code review tool through integrated checklists, not requiring context-switching to external documentation during review sessions.

---

## NFR-003: Accuracy and Effectiveness Requirements

### Non-Functional Requirement
The framework must reliably catch AI-specific issues while minimizing false positives that create review friction.

**NFR-003.1:** The framework shall catch at least ninety percent of AI-generated issues that reach production without the framework, measured by comparing issue rates before and after implementation.

**NFR-003.2:** False positive rate for automated checks shall not exceed ten percent, ensuring reviewers spend time on genuine issues rather than investigating false alarms.

**NFR-003.3:** Critical security vulnerabilities in the targeted categories (SQL injection, authentication bypass, information leakage, hardcoded secrets) shall have a detection rate of ninety-five percent or higher during review.

## Requirements Traceability

Each requirement in this document is identified with a unique ID (FR-XXX for functional requirements, NFR-XXX for non-functional requirements, AC-XXX.X for acceptance criteria) that will be referenced in the design document and implementation plan. This traceability ensures every requirement flows through design decisions into concrete implementation tasks, and that testing validates requirement satisfaction.

The next document in this sequence is the Design Document, which will translate these requirements into architectural components, data models, and integration patterns that enable implementation.
