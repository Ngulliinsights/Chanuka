## Usage Examples

### Starting the Monitoring System
```javascript
import { regulatoryChangeMonitoringService } from './services/regulatory-change-monitoring.js';

// Start automated monitoring
regulatoryChangeMonitoringService.startAutomatedMonitoring();

// Stop monitoring when shutting down
process.on('SIGTERM', () => {
  regulatoryChangeMonitoringService.stopAutomatedMonitoring();
});
```

### Analyzing Stakeholder Impact
```javascript
const impacts = await regulatoryChangeMonitoringService.analyzeStakeholderImpact('reg_123');
```

### Identifying Strategic Opportunities
```javascript
const opportunities = await regulatoryChangeMonitoringService.identifyStrategicOpportunities('reg_123');
```

### Creating Custom Alerts
```javascript
const alert = await regulatoryChangeMonitoringService.createRegulatoryAlert(
  'strategic_opportunity',
  'Potential market expansion opportunity identified',
  'info',
  { regulationId: 'reg_123', marketSegment: 'renewable_energy' }
);
```

## Best Practices

   - Consider multiple scenario outcomes

4. **Risk Management**
   - Evaluate compliance requirements
   - Assess implementation costs
   - Monitor competitive landscape changes

## Future Enhancements
