### Hero Section
**Main Headline:**

"See What Governs You"

**Secondary CTA:**

---

## 2. ONBOARDING SEQUENCE

### Welcome Message
"You're here because something brought you—a question about your rights, frustration with how things work, curiosity about what's possible, or simply the sense that you should understand more than you do. Whatever your reason, you're already participating in democracy just by choosing to understand it better. Every person who knows how power works makes power work differently."

### Profile Setup Intro
"Help us show you what matters to your specific life. Your location, age, occupation, and interests aren't just demographics—they're the coordinates where national policy becomes personal reality. The more specific you are, the more useful we can be."

### First-Time User Tutorial Messages
- "You now know something most people don't. What will you do with this knowledge?"
- "Information is potential power. Application is actual power. What's next?"
- "Questions are power. Start asking."

## 4. FEATURE EXPLAINERS

### Law Translation Feature
"Legal language is designed for lawyers, not for the people laws actually govern. We translate legislation into the language you speak at home, at work, in the market. Not dumbed down—clarified. Not simplified—made accessible. The law means what it means, but it should mean it in words you don't need a degree to understand."

### Differential Impact Analysis
"Two people reading the same law can both be right about what it means for them—because laws don't affect everyone equally. This tool shows you how the same policy creates different realities for different communities, helping you understand both your own position and others' experiences."

### Budget Visualization Tool
"Numbers are narratives. Every line in a budget is a story about priorities, about who matters and who doesn't, about futures imagined and futures foreclosed. We turn spreadsheets into stories you can actually follow, so you can see whose future your government is building."

### Discussion Forums
"Good decisions require hearing from people who see problems differently than you do. Not because truth is relative, but because reality is complex. These structured conversations help you understand perspectives you haven't lived while sharpening your own thinking. Disagreement isn't the problem—it's the raw material democracy is built from."

### Representative Tracking
"You elected people to represent you. Are you watching to see if they're doing it? Track the decision-makers whose choices shape your daily reality. Their votes are public record. Your attention makes those records matter."

---

## 6. EMPTY STATES

### No Saved Items Yet
"You haven't saved anything yet, which means you're either absorbing everything instantly or you haven't found what matters to you. When you do, keep it here. Democracy moves fast, but your reference library can keep pace."

### No Discussion Activity Yet
"Every conversation starts with someone willing to say something first. That person could be you. The questions you're too hesitant to ask are probably the ones ten other people need answered. Start something."

### No Tracked Representatives
"You elected people to represent you. Are you watching to see if they're doing it? Start tracking the decision-makers whose choices shape your daily reality."

### No Community Contributions Yet
"You've been learning. That's valuable. But knowledge becomes power when it's shared. Your perspective—however ordinary it feels to you—is unique. Someone needs to hear it."

---

## 7. CONFIRMATION MESSAGES

### After Account Creation
"You just made yourself harder to govern without your consent. Welcome."

### After Completing Educational Module
"You now understand something that gives you leverage. Every corner of the system you map makes the whole structure more visible."

"Your perspective is now part of the permanent record of this moment. Thank you for not staying silent."

### After Contacting Representative
"They work for you. You just reminded them. That's how accountability starts."

---

## 8. CALL-TO-ACTION COPY

### For New Legislation
"This law was passed three days ago. It goes into effect in thirty days. You have four weeks to understand what it means for you."

### For Representative Contact
"Your representative's position on this is unclear. Unclear positions become whatever positions are convenient later. Make your expectations clear now."

### For Discussion Participation
"Twelve people are trying to understand this issue together. Thirteen perspectives would be better than twelve. Join them."

### For Platform Sharing
"The more people who understand how power works, the more accountable power becomes. Share this with someone who's ready to see more clearly."

### For Budget Review
"Your taxes funded this. You have every right to understand where they went and why."

---

## 9. CONTENT SECTION INTRODUCTIONS

### Constitutional Rights
"These aren't abstract ideals. They're specific tools you can use to defend yourself, your family, and your community from abuse of power. But tools only work if you know they exist and understand how to use them."

### Budget & Finance
"Money trails reveal truth that rhetoric obscures. Follow the money to understand what government actually values versus what it claims to value."

### Electoral Process
"Elections are a moment. Governance is continuous. Understanding the process means understanding how to influence outcomes between elections, when the real work happens."

### Legal Rights & Procedures
"The law applies to you whether you understand it or not. But you can only use it to protect yourself if you know what it says and how it works."

### County/Local Governance
"National politics gets attention. Local governance shapes your daily life. The pothole, the clinic, the school, the water—that's all decided close enough to touch."

---

## 10. ROTATING BANNER MESSAGES

### Daily Rotation Set
1. "Ignorance of the law excuses no one. But understanding the law shouldn't require a law degree."
2. "Every budget is a moral document disguised as a spreadsheet."
3. "The personal isn't just political. The political is deeply, unavoidably personal."
4. "Democracy is a practice, not a state. You're either practicing or you're losing capacity."
5. "Your tax money built the system. Your attention keeps it accountable."
6. "Complexity is often deliberate. Clarity is always political."
7. "The opposite of knowledge isn't ignorance. It's the illusion of knowledge."

---

## 11. SIDEBAR WIDGETS (Persistent Short Messages)

- "Questions are power."
- "Attention is infrastructure."
- "Participation is protection."
- "Clarity is resistance."
- "Your voice is data the system needs."
- "Complexity serves power. Simplicity serves people."
- "Know more. Fear less. Act accordingly."
- "Democracy requires maintenance."
- "Informed consent or just compliance?"
- "Read the fine print of your own governance."

---

## 12. COMMUNITY GUIDELINES & MODERATION

### Discussion Standards
"Disagree fiercely. Question aggressively. Challenge freely. But engage honestly. No one here needs to pretend consensus exists when it doesn't, but everyone here needs to argue in good faith. If you can't imagine being wrong about something, you're not thinking clearly enough to participate in democratic deliberation."

### Content Flagging Guidance
"If you're reporting this because it disagrees with you, don't. If you're reporting it because it violates community standards about respect, honesty, or good faith, do. Democracy requires distinguishing between disagreement and abuse."

### Controversial Topic Introduction
"This issue divides people. That's not a flaw—that's reality. What matters is whether we can hold our divisions productively, learning from each other's perspectives even when we don't adopt them. Read with genuine curiosity about why intelligent people disagree with you."

---

## 13. CONTEXTUAL TOOLTIPS & HELP TEXT

### County Assembly Explanation
"County assemblies make decisions about roads, water, health clinics, and other services you use every day. They control significant budgets and set local policy. They're also the most accessible level of government—you can actually attend their meetings."

### Budget Terms
"A 'recurrent expenditure' is money spent on things that keep happening—salaries, electricity, maintenance. It's different from 'development expenditure,' which is supposed to build new things. Watch how governments classify spending; sometimes ongoing waste gets called development to make it sound productive."

### Public Participation Rights
"Public participation isn't a courtesy governments extend. It's a constitutional requirement. They're supposed to ask your opinion before making decisions that affect you. When they don't, that's not just rude—it's illegal."

### Legislative Process
"A bill becomes law through multiple stages, each designed to allow scrutiny and amendment. When these stages are rushed or bypassed, that's a red flag. The process exists to protect you from hasty, poorly-considered legislation."

---

## 14. EXIT INTENT & RETENTION MESSAGING

### Exit Intent Popup
"Democracy doesn't pause when you log off. Neither do we. Before you go, see what happened today that matters to your life."

### Re-engagement Email Subject
"What Changed While You Weren't Watching"

### Re-engagement Email Body
"We're not here to guilt you about being gone. Everyone gets tired of paying attention. But systems of power don't rest, which means people who want accountable governance can't rest permanently either. Here's what you missed, and here's why it matters to you specifically."

---

## 15. FOOTER & PERSISTENT ELEMENTS

### Mission Statement (Footer)
"Chanuka exists because democracy requires informed citizens, but information alone isn't enough. We make information accessible, understandable, and actionable—translating power into language and language into power."

### Navigation Labels
- **Instead of "About Us":** "Why Chanuka Exists"
- **Instead of "Contact":** "Talk to the People Building This"
- **Instead of "Newsletter":** "Get Weekly Clarity in Your Inbox"
- **Instead of "FAQ":** "Questions Others Have Asked"

---

## 16. ACHIEVEMENT & PROGRESS MESSAGING

"You've mapped three corners of the system. Every corner you understand makes the whole structure more visible."

### Engagement Streak
"Seven days of attention. Democracy thanks you for not looking away."

### Community Contribution
"Five times you've added your perspective to community knowledge. Your voice is part of the record now."

### Representative Contact Milestone
"Third time contacting your representative this year. Accountability requires consistency. Keep going."

---

## 17. SOPHISTICATED AUDIENCE COPY

### For Policy Professionals
"Epistemological clarity in governance: radical transparency isn't enough if what's transparent remains incomprehensible."

"The technocratic fallacy: expertise without accountability is just credentialed power."

"Participatory democracy requires distributed knowledge. Concentrated knowledge produces oligarchy, regardless of formal democratic structures."

### For Academic Users
"Your civic literacy determines your negotiating position with power. Illiteracy means accepting whatever terms power offers."

"Democratic legitimacy requires informed consent. Consent without information is just compliance."

"The pedagogical dimension of governance: every policy teaches citizens what they can expect, what they deserve, what they're worth."

## 19. COMPREHENSIVE MISSION STATEMENT

### Full Platform Philosophy (About Page)

"Chanuka exists because democracy has an information problem that corrupts everything else. Power concentrates partly through force, but mostly through obscurity. When governance becomes incomprehensible, citizens become subjects. When law becomes inaccessible, rights become privileges. When budgets become indecipherable, theft becomes policy.

We believe that making governance comprehensible is itself a form of governance reform. That translation is political action. That clarity is resistance to systems that benefit from confusion.

We don't claim neutrality—we're explicitly on the side of informed citizenship against obscurantist power. But we do claim honesty. We explain what laws say, not what we wish they said. We show how systems work, not how we think they should work. We translate without editorializing, clarify without propagandizing.

Our bias is toward comprehension. Our allegiance is to citizens who want to understand the forces shaping their lives.

This platform is infrastructure for democratic capacity. It's a tool, not a movement. But we believe that people who understand how power works will inevitably use that understanding to make power work differently. That's not activism—that's just what informed citizens do.

We're not here to tell you what to think or what to do. We're here to give you the information and frameworks you need to think clearly and act effectively on your own behalf and on behalf of the communities you care about.

Everything else follows from that."
