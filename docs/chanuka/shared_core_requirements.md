# Requirements Document: Shared Core Structure Optimization

**Document ID**: REQ-CORE-OPT-001  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: Draft for Review

---

## Executive Summary

This requirements document establishes the functional and non-functional requirements for consolidating and optimizing the `shared/core` directory structure. The current architecture suffers from extensive duplication (five copies of BaseError, three circuit breakers, four logger implementations), circular dependencies, and poor discoverability. This optimization will establish a single canonical source of truth for each capability while maintaining backward compatibility during migration.

---

## Stakeholders and Personas

- **Systems Architect**: Ensures architectural integrity and dependency hygiene
- **Developer Advocate**: Optimizes developer experience and learning curve
- **Quality Engineer**: Validates testability and reliability metrics
- **Technical Lead**: Balances delivery timelines with technical excellence
- **Platform Engineer**: Maintains operational stability during migration

---

## Core Problem Statement

The current `shared/core` structure has evolved organically, resulting in:
- **Duplication**: Five implementations of BaseError across error-handling/, errors/, and utils/
- **Circular Dependencies**: Logging imports errors which imports logging
- **Poor Discoverability**: Three separate locations for rate-limiting logic
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: AI-specific features exist as parallel systems rather than specialized adapters
- **Bundle Bloat**: Multiple barrel exports lead to duplicate code in final bundles
- **Onboarding Friction**: New developers must read twelve separate README files to understand the system

---

## Requirement Categories

### 1. Structural Consolidation Requirements

#### REQ-1.1: Unified Error Management System

**User Story**: As a backend developer, I want a single canonical error handling system, so that I can consistently handle errors across all application layers without choosing between multiple implementations.

**WHEN** a module needs to define or throw a specialized error  
**THEN** the system SHALL provide exactly one BaseError class located in `error-management/errors/base-error.ts`  
**WHERE** all existing error types (ValidationError, NotFoundError, AuthenticationError) extend this single base and no duplicate implementations exist in the codebase

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. GIVEN five current implementations of BaseError WHEN consolidation completes THEN exactly one canonical BaseError exists in error-management/errors/base-error.ts with all features from previous implementations merged
2. GIVEN specialized error classes (ValidationError, NotFoundError, etc.) WHEN imported THEN they resolve to error-management/errors/specialized/ with no alternative paths available
3. GIVEN existing code importing from legacy paths WHEN accessed THEN a deprecation warning appears in development mode but functionality remains intact for one release cycle
4. GIVEN the error management barrel export WHEN imported THEN tree-shaking eliminates unused error classes from final bundles
5. GIVEN error-related code WHEN analyzed by dependency tooling THEN zero circular dependencies exist between error-management and other capabilities
6. GIVEN the consolidated error system WHEN tested THEN 100% of existing error-handling test cases pass without modification

---

#### REQ-1.2: Unified Caching Abstraction

**User Story**: As a platform engineer, I want a single caching interface with specialized adapters, so that I can switch between memory, Redis, or multi-tier caching without changing application code.

**WHEN** a service requires caching functionality  
**THEN** the system SHALL provide a unified CacheInterface in `caching/core/cache-interface.ts` with implementations as adapters in `caching/adapters/`  
**WHERE** AI-enhanced caching exists as a specialized adapter rather than a separate parallel system

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. GIVEN multiple cache implementations (memory, Redis, AI-enhanced) WHEN accessing caching THEN all implement the same CacheInterface with get, set, delete, and clear methods
2. GIVEN AI-specific caching needs (deduplication, cost tracking) WHEN using AI adapter THEN these features exist as extensions of the base interface without creating a parallel caching system
3. GIVEN a multi-tier cache strategy WHEN configured THEN the multi-tier-adapter.ts orchestrates between L1 (memory) and L2 (Redis) transparently
4. GIVEN cache key generation WHEN creating keys THEN a single cache-key-builder.ts ensures consistency across all adapters
5. GIVEN cache operations WHEN monitoring THEN cache-stats.ts tracks hit/miss ratios uniformly across all adapter types
6. GIVEN existing cache usage WHEN migrating THEN legacy adapters in caching/legacy-adapters/ bridge to new implementation preserving all current behavior

---

#### REQ-1.3: Unified Observability System

**User Story**: As a DevOps engineer, I want integrated logging, health checks, metrics, and tracing, so that I can diagnose production issues through a cohesive observability interface.

**WHEN** the system requires diagnostic capabilities  
**THEN** the system SHALL consolidate logging, health monitoring, metrics collection, and distributed tracing into `observability/` with coordinated telemetry export  
**WHERE** all observability concerns share context propagation and correlation IDs

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. GIVEN separate logging/, health/, and monitoring/ directories WHEN consolidated THEN observability/ contains subdirectories for logging, health, metrics, tracing, and telemetry with shared context
2. GIVEN log rotation requirements WHEN logging THEN observability/logging/rotation/ provides configurable rotation strategies without separate log management systems
3. GIVEN health check needs WHEN monitoring system health THEN observability/health/ orchestrates checks for database, Redis, memory, disk, and external services through a unified health-checker.ts
4. GIVEN distributed request tracing WHEN processing requests THEN observability/tracing/ propagates correlation IDs and creates spans that link logs, metrics, and traces
5. GIVEN four separate logger implementations WHEN consolidating THEN exactly one logger.ts exists in observability/logging/ with all features from previous implementations
6. GIVEN Prometheus metrics export WHEN collecting metrics THEN observability/metrics/exporters/prometheus-exporter.ts formats data consistently with OpenTelemetry standards

---

### 2. Dependency Hygiene Requirements

#### REQ-2.1: Strict Layered Architecture

**User Story**: As a systems architect, I want enforced layer boundaries, so that lower-level code never depends on higher-level concerns and circular dependencies become impossible.

**WHEN** any module attempts to import from another module  
**THEN** the system SHALL enforce that Layer N only imports from Layer N-1 or below  
**WHERE** layers are: (1) Primitives, (2) Core Capabilities, (3) Cross-Cutting Concerns, (4) Development Support

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. GIVEN the four-layer architecture WHEN primitives/ code imports THEN it imports zero internal shared/core modules and depends only on external libraries
2. GIVEN core capabilities (error-management, caching, observability, validation, rate-limiting) WHEN importing THEN they import only from primitives/ and not from each other
3. GIVEN cross-cutting concerns (middleware, config, utils) WHEN importing THEN they import from primitives and capabilities but not from development support
4. GIVEN development support code (testing, migration) WHEN importing THEN it may import from any layer but no production code imports from it
5. GIVEN ESLint dependency rules WHEN linting THEN violations of layer boundaries fail the build with clear error messages indicating the correct layer
6. GIVEN the dependency graph WHEN visualized THEN it forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with no cycles at any scope

---

#### REQ-2.2: Primitives Foundation Layer

**User Story**: As a TypeScript developer, I want pure type definitions and constants with zero dependencies, so that I can safely import foundational types anywhere without pulling in implementation details.

**WHEN** foundational types or constants are needed  
**THEN** the system SHALL provide them in `primitives/` with no internal imports  
**WHERE** Result<T,E>, Maybe<T>, branded types, and base error classes live with zero coupling

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. GIVEN common type needs WHEN defining types THEN primitives/types/ contains result.ts, maybe.ts, branded.ts, and common.ts with pure TypeScript types
2. GIVEN the BaseError abstract class WHEN defining errors THEN primitives/errors/base-error.ts contains only the abstract class with no specialized implementations
3. GIVEN constant definitions WHEN accessing constants THEN primitives/constants/ provides http-status.ts, time-constants.ts with no computation logic
4. GIVEN primitives barrel export WHEN imported THEN bundle size analysis shows zero transitive dependencies from primitives
5. GIVEN any primitives file WHEN analyzed THEN it imports only from TypeScript standard library or zero-dependency type libraries like zod
6. GIVEN primitives documentation WHEN reading THEN each file clearly states it must remain dependency-free and explains the architectural rationale

---

### 3. Discoverability Requirements

#### REQ-3.1: Single Canonical Location Per Capability

**User Story**: As a new team member, I want to find functionality in one obvious place, so that I don't waste time searching through multiple directories or choosing between duplicate implementations.

**WHEN** a developer needs a specific capability (error handling, caching, logging, etc.)  
**THEN** the system SHALL provide exactly one directory for that capability with all related code  
**WHERE** naming follows the pattern: capability-name/ contains core/, adapters/, patterns/, middleware/

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. GIVEN error handling needs WHEN searching THEN error-management/ is the single source with no competing error-handling/, errors/, or utils/error-handler.ts locations
2. GIVEN caching needs WHEN searching THEN caching/ is the single source with no competing cache/ or AI-specific cache directories
3. GIVEN validation needs WHEN searching THEN validation/ contains all schemas, sanitization, and rules with no separate sanitization/ directory
4. GIVEN directory structure WHEN listing THEN each capability directory follows consistent internal structure: core/ for interfaces, adapters/ for implementations, patterns/ for advanced usage
5. GIVEN IDE autocomplete WHEN typing an import THEN only one canonical path appears for each symbol (no duplicate exports from different locations)
6. GIVEN new developer onboarding WHEN learning the system THEN a single README.md at shared/core/ explains the entire structure with links to each capability's documentation

---

#### REQ-3.2: Consistent Adapter Pattern

**User Story**: As a backend developer, I want specialized behavior implemented as adapters of core interfaces, so that AI-specific or domain-specific concerns don't create parallel systems.

**WHEN** a capability needs specialized behavior (AI rate-limiting, Redis caching, etc.)  
**THEN** the system SHALL implement it as an adapter in [capability]/adapters/  
**WHERE** the adapter implements the core interface from [capability]/core/

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. GIVEN AI rate-limiting needs WHEN implementing THEN rate-limiting/adapters/ai-rate-limiter.ts extends the base rate limiter with cost tracking
2. GIVEN Redis caching needs WHEN implementing THEN caching/adapters/redis-adapter.ts implements CacheInterface with Redis-specific optimizations
3. GIVEN multi-tier caching WHEN implementing THEN caching/adapters/multi-tier-adapter.ts composes memory-adapter and redis-adapter
4. GIVEN any adapter WHEN reviewing code THEN it imports only from its capability's core/ directory and from primitives, never from other capabilities
5. GIVEN adapter selection WHEN configuring THEN application code depends only on the interface, with adapter selection happening at composition root
6. GIVEN new specialized needs WHEN extending capabilities THEN the pattern is documented: create new adapter in adapters/, implement core interface, document in capability README

---

### 4. Migration and Backward Compatibility Requirements

#### REQ-4.1: Zero-Downtime Migration Path

**User Story**: As a technical lead, I want to migrate gradually with feature flags, so that we can roll back instantly if issues arise and minimize risk to production systems.

**WHEN** migrating from old structure to new structure  
**THEN** the system SHALL maintain old barrel exports that re-export from new locations for one release cycle  
**WHERE** feature flags control which code path executes in production

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. GIVEN old import paths (shared/core/error-handling/) WHEN used THEN barrel exports re-export from new canonical location (shared/core/error-management/) with deprecation warnings in dev mode
2. GIVEN feature flag useNewCoreStructure WHEN false THEN application uses old code paths and new code is not loaded into production
3. GIVEN feature flag useNewCoreStructure WHEN true THEN application uses new consolidated code with monitoring comparing behavior against old implementation
4. GIVEN migration in progress WHEN errors occur THEN old and new implementations coexist safely with no symbol conflicts or runtime errors
5. GIVEN one sprint of production traffic WHEN new code has run successfully THEN technical lead can safely delete old barrels and mark old directories as deprecated
6. GIVEN deprecation period expiry WHEN removing old code THEN compilation errors clearly indicate new import paths with automated codemod scripts available

---

#### REQ-4.2: Automated Migration Tooling

**User Story**: As a developer, I want automated tools to migrate my imports, so that I don't manually update hundreds of import statements across the codebase.

**WHEN** migrating import statements from old to new structure  
**THEN** the system SHALL provide codemods and validation scripts in `migration/scripts/`  
**WHERE** tools detect old patterns and automatically rewrite them to new canonical locations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. GIVEN old import statements WHEN running migration/scripts/migrate-imports.ts THEN all imports are automatically rewritten to new canonical paths with backup files created
2. GIVEN migrated code WHEN running migration/scripts/validate-migration.ts THEN script verifies no old import patterns remain and all symbols resolve correctly
3. GIVEN incomplete migration WHEN running validation THEN clear report shows which files still use old imports with suggested fixes
4. GIVEN migration in progress WHEN committing code THEN pre-commit hooks warn about old import patterns and suggest running migration tool
5. GIVEN large codebase WHEN migrating THEN tool processes files in dependency order (primitives first, then capabilities, then cross-cutting, then apps)
6. GIVEN test failures after migration WHEN investigating THEN rollback script restores previous state from backup files with zero data loss

---

### 5. Testing and Validation Requirements

#### REQ-5.1: Comprehensive Test Migration

**User Story**: As a quality engineer, I want all existing tests to pass after consolidation, so that we maintain confidence that no functionality was lost during restructuring.

2. GIVEN consolidated error management WHEN running tests THEN error-management/__tests__/ contains all tests from previous error-handling/, errors/, and utils/error-handler tests with no duplicates
3. GIVEN test coverage metrics WHEN measuring THEN coverage percentage remains identical or improves compared to pre-consolidation baseline
4. GIVEN integration tests WHEN running THEN tests validate interactions between capabilities (error-management + observability, caching + rate-limiting)
5. GIVEN performance benchmarks WHEN comparing THEN new structure has equal or better performance than old structure across all critical paths
6. GIVEN CI pipeline WHEN running THEN all test suites (unit, integration, performance) pass before any merge to main branch

---

#### REQ-5.2: Dependency Validation Tooling

**User Story**: As a systems architect, I want automated validation of dependency rules, so that accidental circular dependencies or layer violations are caught immediately in CI.

**WHEN** code is committed or CI pipeline runs  
**THEN** the system SHALL validate layer boundaries and detect circular dependencies  
**WHERE** violations fail the build with clear guidance on how to fix

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. GIVEN ESLint plugin eslint-plugin-import WHEN configured THEN rules enforce no-circular-dependencies across entire shared/core
2. GIVEN custom ESLint rules WHEN linting THEN layer boundary violations are detected (e.g., primitives importing from capabilities)

6. GIVEN documentation maintenance WHEN updating code THEN CI pipeline fails if public API changes without corresponding documentation updates

---

#### REQ-6.2: Migration Guide Documentation

6. GIVEN migration progress tracking WHEN monitoring THEN guide provides checklist template for tracking completion of each phase with responsible parties and deadlines

---

### 7. Performance Requirements

#### REQ-7.1: Bundle Size Optimization

**User Story**: As a frontend engineer, I want tree-shakeable imports, so that my application bundles include only the code I actually use from shared/core.

**WHEN** bundling application code that imports from shared/core  
**THEN** the system SHALL enable tree-shaking to eliminate unused exports  
**WHERE** barrel exports use named exports and avoid side effects in module initialization

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. GIVEN application importing single function from shared/core WHEN bundling THEN only that function and its direct dependencies appear in output bundle
2. GIVEN barrel exports (index.ts files) WHEN constructed THEN they use export { x } from './x' syntax without re-exporting everything with export *

4. GIVEN bundle analysis WHEN comparing THEN new structure reduces shared/core contribution to bundle by at least 20% compared to old structure
5. GIVEN unused capabilities WHEN tree-shaking THEN entire capability directories are eliminated if application doesn't import from them
6. GIVEN production builds WHEN measuring THEN bundle size metrics are tracked in CI with alerts if shared/core contribution increases beyond threshold

---

#### REQ-7.2: Runtime Performance Parity

2. GIVEN error rates WHEN comparing THEN dashboard visualizes error rates from old code path vs new code path side-by-side with statistical significance testing
3. GIVEN performance metrics WHEN tracking THEN P50, P95, P99 latencies are collected separately for old and new implementations for all critical operations
4. GIVEN migration anomalies WHEN detected THEN alerts fire if new code path error rate exceeds old path by >2 standard deviations

## Success Criteria Summary

The consolidated shared/core structure will be considered successful when:

1. **Zero Duplication**: Exactly one canonical implementation exists for each capability (BaseError, CircuitBreaker, Logger, etc.)
2. **Strict Dependency Hygiene**: Automated tooling confirms zero circular dependencies and all layer boundaries are respected
3. **Complete Test Coverage**: 100% of pre-migration tests pass with coverage equal to or exceeding baseline
4. **Performance Parity**: All benchmarks show <5% variance from baseline with no regressions
5. **Successful Migration**: 200+ files successfully migrated with zero production incidents
6. **Bundle Size Improvement**: Tree-shaking reduces shared/core contribution to bundles by ≥20%
7. **Documentation Complete**: Each capability has comprehensive README with examples and architectural decisions recorded
8. **Developer Satisfaction**: Team survey shows ≥80% agreement that new structure is easier to understand and navigate

---

## Non-Requirements (Out of Scope)

The following are explicitly **not** part of this consolidation effort:

1. **Application Code Refactoring**: Only shared/core structure changes; application-level code using shared/core is out of scope
2. **New Feature Development**: This is purely consolidation; no new capabilities are added
3. **Framework Migration**: No changes to Express, React, or other framework dependencies
4. **Database Schema Changes**: Consolidation is code-only; database structure remains unchanged
5. **External API Changes**: Public APIs exposed to clients remain unchanged
6. **Infrastructure Changes**: No changes to deployment, CI/CD pipelines beyond adding validation tooling
