# Chanuka Platform Restructuring Requirements

## Document Control
- **Version**: 3.0 (Unified)
- **Date**: October 13, 2025
- **Status**: Authoritative Specification
- **Authors**: Strategic Architecture Team
- **Change Summary**: Synthesized centralized architecture approach with enhanced domain organization, comprehensive testing strategy, and developer experience improvements

## Executive Summary

This requirements document defines the comprehensive structural reorganization needed to transform the Chanuka civic engagement platform from its current fragmented state into a maintainable, scalable architecture built on centralized infrastructure. The restructuring consolidates all cross-cutting concerns into a unified shared layer, establishes clear domain boundaries that reflect business capabilities, eliminates experimental code paths that create confusion, and provides world-class developer experience through self-documenting architecture and comprehensive tooling. This centralization strategy reduces duplication by over fifty percent, improves testability through consolidated utilities, creates foundation for sustainable growth across multiple legislative contexts, and accelerates feature development by establishing clear patterns that guide developers toward correct implementations.

## Problem Statement

The current codebase exhibits critical fragmentation across multiple dimensions that compounds technical debt and constrains development velocity. Infrastructure concerns scatter across server/core, server/infrastructure, and the experimental docs/core directory, creating uncertainty about which implementations are production-ready and forcing developers to audit multiple locations before making changes. Database functionality distributes across server/infrastructure/database, server/db.ts, and shared/database with inconsistent connection management patterns that lead to connection leaks and performance degradation. Utility functions proliferate in server/utils, client/src/utils, and shared/core/src/utils without clear ownership, resulting in subtle behavioral differences that cause bugs when developers choose the wrong implementation. Testing utilities duplicate across multiple directories, making it impossible to maintain consistent quality standards and forcing each test suite to reinvent common patterns. Feature boundaries remain unclear with tangled dependencies between what should be independent business domains, preventing parallel development and making impact analysis nearly impossible. This fragmentation creates friction at every development touchpoint, slows onboarding of new team members, increases bug rates through inconsistent implementations, and prevents the platform from scaling to support additional legislative contexts without further restructuring.

## Strategic Goals

The restructuring must achieve eight interconnected objectives that build systematically toward architectural excellence. First, it must consolidate all infrastructure concerns into the shared folder under a clear organizational structure that separates cross-cutting technical concerns from domain-specific business logic, establishing single authoritative implementations that eliminate confusion and prevent drift. Second, it must centralize database functionality into a unified location within shared that provides consistent connection management, type-safe query building, coordinated transaction handling, and comprehensive migration management across all application components. Third, it must eliminate the experimental docs/core directory by migrating production-worthy components to their proper locations and archiving the remainder, removing ambiguity about which implementations developers should use. Fourth, it must establish clear import paths using TypeScript path aliases and barrel exports that make infrastructure dependencies explicit, prevent circular references, and guide developers toward correct usage patterns. Fifth, it must organize business logic by domain capability rather than technical layer, creating feature modules that encapsulate related functionality and expose clear interfaces while keeping implementation details private. Sixth, it must consolidate testing infrastructure into shared utilities that eliminate boilerplate, establish consistent patterns, and make comprehensive test coverage achievable and maintainable. Seventh, it must create self-documenting architecture through intuitive directory structure, comprehensive inline documentation, architecture decision records, and migration guides that enable new developers to become productive within days rather than weeks. Eighth, it must maintain backward compatibility throughout migration using adapter patterns and feature flags that enable incremental rollout with zero user-facing disruption, ensuring the platform continues delivering value while the transformation proceeds.

## Constraints and Assumptions

This requirements document operates under several critical constraints and assumptions that define the scope and approach of the restructuring effort.

**Technology Stack**: The restructuring assumes the current technology stack remains consistent including React for frontend, Node.js for backend, PostgreSQL for primary database, Redis for caching, and TypeScript throughout. Any changes to core technologies would require reassessment of architectural decisions.

**Team Capacity**: The plan assumes the development team has capacity to execute a multi-phase migration over approximately six months with roughly thirty percent of development capacity allocated to restructuring work. Feature development will continue at reduced velocity during migration.

**Backward Compatibility**: The restructuring must maintain backward compatibility throughout the migration period ensuring zero user-facing disruption. This constraint influences migration strategy requiring adapter patterns and feature flags.

**Zero Downtime**: All migration activities must support zero-downtime deployment requiring blue-green deployment capabilities and database migration patterns that support both old and new code simultaneously.

**Testing Infrastructure**: The plan assumes automated testing infrastructure exists and can be enhanced. Achieving eighty percent coverage requires investment in testing utilities and developer time for test writing.

**Stakeholder Buy-in**: The restructuring assumes stakeholders understand the long-term value of reducing technical debt and accept temporary reduction in feature velocity. Regular communication maintains alignment throughout migration.

**Production Access**: The plan assumes the team has appropriate production access for monitoring, rollback, and troubleshooting while maintaining security through proper access controls and audit logging.

**Resource Availability**: The restructuring assumes adequate development, testing, and staging environments are available for parallel testing and gradual rollout strategies.

**Documentation Culture**: Success depends on maintaining comprehensive documentation requiring cultural commitment to keeping documentation current as implementation progresses.

**Migration Timeline**: The six-month timeline assumes no major blocking issues emerge. Buffer is included for unexpected challenges, but major architectural discoveries could extend timeline.

## Traceability Matrix

Each requirement in this document will be traced through the entire development lifecycle from specification to validation ensuring complete coverage and enabling impact analysis. Requirements identified with R-prefixes (R1.1, R2.3, etc.) will be referenced consistently in all related artifacts creating end-to-end traceability.

Architecture decision records will reference requirements they satisfy explaining how specific decisions support requirement achievement. Design specifications will map to requirements showing how high-level requirements decompose into detailed designs. Implementation tasks in project management systems will reference requirements ensuring all work traces back to business needs. Code comments will reference requirements for particularly complex implementations explaining why code exists and what requirement it satisfies. Test cases will explicitly verify requirement satisfaction with requirement IDs in test names and descriptions. Migration documentation will reference requirements affected by each migration phase. Performance benchmarks will validate non-functional requirements with measurements tracked over time.

This comprehensive traceability ensures that business needs drive all architectural decisions, all requirements receive appropriate implementation and validation, impact analysis can determine what changes affect which requirements, and stakeholders can track progress toward requirement satisfaction through metrics dashboards. Traceability matrices will be maintained in living documents updated as implementation progresses and reviewed regularly for completeness.

## Conclusion

This unified requirements document represents the comprehensive blueprint for transforming the Chanuka platform from its current fragmented state into a maintainable, scalable architecture built on centralized infrastructure. By consolidating all cross-cutting concerns into a unified shared layer, establishing clear domain boundaries, eliminating experimental code paths, and providing world-class developer experience, we create a foundation for sustainable growth.

The success of this restructuring depends on disciplined execution of the phased migration approach, commitment to backward compatibility throughout the transition, comprehensive testing at every stage, and continuous communication with all stakeholders. The measurable success criteria, key performance indicators, and risk mitigation strategies provide the framework for tracking progress and addressing challenges as they emerge.

This restructuring is not merely a technical exercise but a strategic investment in the platform's future. By reducing technical debt, improving code quality, and accelerating development velocity, we enable the Chanuka platform to scale across multiple legislative contexts, support growing user bases, and continue delivering value through civic engagement innovation.

The requirements in this document trace through the entire development lifecycle from specification to implementation to validation, ensuring that every architectural decision serves the overarching business goals of maintainability, scalability, and developer productivity. Through careful execution of these requirements, we build not just better code, but a better foundation for democratic engagement.
