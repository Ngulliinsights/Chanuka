## 1. Caching System Consolidation

### REQ-CACHE-001: Unified Cache Adapter Interface
**User Story**: As a backend developer, I want a single consistent caching interface so that I can implement caching patterns without navigating multiple competing implementations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

WHEN a developer needs to implement caching THEN the system SHALL provide a unified `CacheAdapter` interface that supports get, set, delete, clear, and exists operations WHERE all cache implementations (memory, Redis, multi-tier, AI-specific) conform to this single interface contract.

WHEN any cache adapter initializes THEN it SHALL implement standardized lifecycle methods including initialize, healthCheck, shutdown, and getMetrics WHERE health checks return structured status information including connectivity and performance metrics.

WHEN cache operations encounter errors THEN the system SHALL propagate errors through the shared error management system WHERE errors include operation context, affected keys, and adapter-specific diagnostic information.

WHEN developers switch between cache implementations THEN the system SHALL maintain behavioral consistency through the adapter interface WHERE only configuration changes are required without modifying consuming service code.

WHEN multi-tier caching is configured THEN the system SHALL provide a transparent multi-tier adapter WHERE read operations check tiers sequentially and write operations propagate to all configured tiers automatically.

WHEN AI-specific caching requirements exist THEN the system SHALL provide specialized adapters extending the base interface WHERE token counting, embedding storage, and response streaming capabilities are supported without breaking the standard contract.

### REQ-CACHE-002: Cache Factory Unification
**User Story**: As a system architect, I want centralized cache instantiation through a single factory so that cache creation is consistent, testable, and properly integrated with observability systems.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

WHEN the application initializes caching subsystems THEN the system SHALL provide a `CacheFactory` that creates instances based on validated configuration WHERE factory methods reject invalid configurations with descriptive error messages before instantiation.

WHEN cache instances are created THEN the factory SHALL automatically register them with the observability system WHERE all cache operations emit structured logs and metrics without requiring manual instrumentation.

WHEN legacy cache creation patterns exist THEN the system SHALL provide backward-compatible factory methods WHERE existing instantiation code delegates internally to the new factory during the migration period.

WHEN application shutdown occurs THEN the factory SHALL maintain a registry of active cache instances WHERE coordinated cleanup operations ensure graceful shutdown across all registered caches.

WHEN developers write unit tests THEN the factory SHALL support dependency injection patterns WHERE mock cache adapters can be provided through configuration or constructor parameters.

WHEN performance benchmarking is needed THEN the factory SHALL support creating instrumented cache instances WHERE detailed performance metrics are collected for analysis.

## 2. Middleware System Standardization

### REQ-MIDDLEWARE-001: Consolidated Middleware Factory
**User Story**: As a backend developer, I want a unified middleware factory that replaces scattered creation patterns so that middleware integration follows predictable, testable patterns across all routes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

WHEN middleware needs creation THEN the system SHALL provide a single `MiddlewareFactory` consolidating functionality from factory.ts, enhanced-factory.ts, and unified.ts WHERE all existing middleware creation patterns are supported through the unified interface.

WHEN middleware registers with the factory THEN the system SHALL validate required configuration and dependencies WHERE validation failures produce actionable error messages identifying missing or invalid configuration.

WHEN middleware requires shared services THEN the factory SHALL provide dependency injection WHERE logging, metrics, caching, and configuration services are available through a consistent service container.

WHEN middleware initialization fails THEN the system SHALL prevent application startup with clear error messages WHERE the application never enters a partially initialized state that could cause runtime failures.

WHEN middleware execution order matters THEN the factory SHALL support explicit ordering declarations WHERE developers can specify dependencies between middleware components to ensure correct execution sequence.

WHEN conditional middleware activation is required THEN the system SHALL support feature flags and environment-based configuration WHERE middleware can be enabled or disabled without code modifications.

### REQ-MIDDLEWARE-002: Provider Directory Organization
**User Story**: As a system maintainer, I want middleware providers organized in a clear, consistent directory structure so that locating and maintaining specific middleware implementations is straightforward.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

WHEN middleware providers exist in the codebase THEN they SHALL be organized within a dedicated providers subdirectory WHERE each provider resides in its own file following the naming pattern {name}-provider.ts.

WHEN new middleware is added to the system THEN it SHALL follow the established provider pattern WHERE initialization logic, configuration handling, and request processing are clearly separated into distinct functions.

WHEN middleware integrates with observability THEN it SHALL use unified observability services WHERE correlation IDs propagate automatically across all middleware layers without manual threading.

WHEN middleware configuration updates occur THEN the system SHALL validate configuration at application startup WHERE invalid configurations prevent startup and provide clear diagnostic information.

WHEN middleware dependency graphs become complex THEN the system SHALL detect circular dependencies during initialization WHERE validation occurs before request processing begins.

WHEN developers search for middleware implementations THEN the directory structure SHALL make locations obvious WHERE auth, cache, error-handler, rate-limit, and validation middleware each have clearly defined locations.

## 3. Observability Integration

### REQ-OBS-001: Unified Observability Stack
**User Story**: As a DevOps engineer, I want all observability signals coordinated through a single initialization point so that logging, metrics, tracing, and health checks work cohesively with shared context.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

WHEN the application initializes THEN the system SHALL provide an `ObservabilityStack` class coordinating all observability components WHERE logging, metrics, tracing, and health check systems are configured together with shared context.

WHEN observability systems activate THEN correlation IDs SHALL generate automatically and propagate across all signals WHERE logs, metrics, and traces can be correlated for any request throughout its lifecycle.

WHEN components emit metrics THEN the system SHALL enforce standardized metric naming following the pattern {service}.{component}.{metric_name} WHERE metric names are consistent across all services and environments.

WHEN health checks execute THEN the system SHALL aggregate component health status WHERE overall system health accurately reflects the state of all critical dependencies with appropriate weighting.

WHEN distributed operations span multiple services THEN tracing context SHALL propagate automatically WHERE span relationships correctly represent the complete call hierarchy across service boundaries.

WHEN observability configuration requires updates THEN the system SHALL support runtime configuration changes WHERE log levels, sampling rates, and metric collection can be adjusted without application restart.

### REQ-OBS-002: Aggregated Health Monitoring
**User Story**: As a monitoring engineer, I want comprehensive health checks that accurately reflect system dependencies so that alerts correctly identify unhealthy states and their root causes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

WHEN health checks execute THEN the system SHALL verify database connectivity, cache availability, and external service reachability WHERE each check returns detailed status including response time, error rates, and relevant metadata.

WHEN critical dependencies become unhealthy THEN the aggregated health endpoint SHALL report degraded or unhealthy status WHERE the response clearly indicates which specific dependencies are affected and their current state.

WHEN health checks have high execution cost THEN the system SHALL cache results with configurable time-to-live WHERE repeated health check requests within the cache window return cached results to prevent system overload.

WHEN health endpoints are invoked THEN responses SHALL include detailed component-level status WHERE debugging information helps operations teams quickly identify failure root causes.

WHEN health checks fail repeatedly THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breakers WHERE temporarily failing checks are disabled to prevent cascading failures while allowing periodic recovery attempts.

WHEN health status transitions occur THEN the system SHALL emit structured events WHERE monitoring systems can trigger alerts based on state changes and their severity.

## 4. Validation Consolidation

### REQ-VAL-001: Centralized Schema Management
**User Story**: As a full-stack developer, I want all validation schemas centralized in a clear structure so that I can easily find, reuse, and maintain validation logic across the application.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

WHEN validation schemas are defined THEN they SHALL reside in shared/core/src/validation/schemas/ WHERE schemas are organized by domain such as auth, common, property, and bill with clear separation of concerns.

WHEN developers implement validation THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation on when to use Zod, Joi, or custom validators WHERE guidance explains the appropriate use cases, performance characteristics, and type safety benefits of each approach.

WHEN validation operations fail THEN errors SHALL follow a consistent structure WHERE field names, error messages, validation rule identifiers, and error codes are predictable across all validator implementations.

WHEN schemas need sharing between client and server THEN the system SHALL export type-safe schemas WHERE TypeScript types are automatically derived from validation schemas ensuring compile-time type safety.

WHEN validation rules evolve THEN the system SHALL support schema versioning WHERE breaking changes are clearly marked, deprecated schemas remain available during migration periods, and migration paths are documented.

WHEN validation performance is critical THEN the system SHALL support both synchronous and asynchronous validation modes WHERE expensive validations can be deferred, parallelized, or selectively disabled based on context.

### REQ-VAL-002: Consistent Validation Middleware
**User Story**: As a backend developer, I want validation middleware that behaves identically across all endpoints so that validation behavior is predictable and error handling is consistent.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

WHEN validation middleware is applied to routes THEN it SHALL validate request bodies, query parameters, and path parameters WHERE validation failures consistently return structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.

WHEN validation succeeds THEN validated and sanitized data SHALL be available on the request object WHERE TypeScript type guards ensure type safety for validated data throughout the request lifecycle.

WHEN validation fails THEN middleware SHALL return 400 Bad Request with structured error details WHERE each validation error includes the field name, submitted value, and the specific validation rule that failed.

WHEN custom validation rules are necessary THEN the system SHALL support validator composition WHERE common validation patterns can be packaged as reusable functions and combined with schema validators.

WHEN validation errors require internationalization THEN error messages SHALL support i18n WHERE message keys map to translated strings based on request locale.

WHEN validation performance is critical THEN the system SHALL support schema compilation caching WHERE compiled validation functions are reused across requests to minimize overhead.

## 5. Error Management Standardization

### REQ-ERR-001: Unified Error Hierarchy
**User Story**: As a developer, I want all application errors to extend from a common base class so that error handling, logging, and recovery strategies are consistent throughout the codebase.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

WHEN errors are created THEN they SHALL extend from `BaseError` in shared/core/src/primitives/errors/ WHERE all errors include HTTP status code, application error code, human-readable message, and structured metadata.

WHEN errors are thrown THEN they SHALL automatically integrate with the observability system WHERE errors are logged with appropriate severity, full context, and correlation IDs without manual instrumentation.

WHEN errors propagate through middleware and service layers THEN correlation IDs SHALL be maintained WHERE errors can be traced back to their originating request across all system boundaries.

WHEN specific error scenarios require specialized handling THEN the system SHALL provide domain-specific error classes WHERE ValidationError, AuthenticationError, DatabaseError, and ExternalServiceError extend the base with appropriate defaults.

WHEN errors need to communicate recovery strategies THEN error metadata SHALL include retry information WHERE clients understand whether operations are safely retryable and what backoff strategies to employ.

WHEN errors are serialized for API responses THEN sensitive information SHALL be filtered WHERE stack traces, internal paths, and security-sensitive details are not exposed to external clients.

## 6. Migration Strategy

### REQ-MIG-001: Incremental Migration Support
**User Story**: As a team lead, I want to migrate to the refined shared/core incrementally so that we deliver value continuously without risking a large, coordinated release.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

WHEN legacy implementations exist THEN the system SHALL provide adapter bridges in legacy-adapters directories WHERE old interfaces delegate internally to new implementations ensuring backward compatibility.

WHEN both old and new implementations coexist THEN the system SHALL support feature flags WHERE teams can toggle between implementations at the service level or per-route level for controlled rollout.

WHEN migration is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide validation tools WHERE teams can compare outputs from old and new implementations to verify behavioral equivalence.

WHEN legacy code approaches deprecation THEN the system SHALL log structured deprecation warnings WHERE teams have clear visibility into what requires migration and the urgency level.

WHEN migration guidance is needed THEN documentation SHALL provide side-by-side examples WHERE each legacy pattern has a corresponding modern equivalent with migration steps.

WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL provide automated cleanup scripts WHERE legacy code can be safely removed after verification that all consumers have successfully migrated.

### REQ-MIG-002: Breaking Change Management
**User Story**: As a platform engineer, I want breaking changes to follow a structured deprecation cycle so that consuming services have adequate time to adapt without service disruptions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

WHEN breaking changes are introduced THEN deprecated functionality SHALL remain available for at least one major version WHERE consuming services have sufficient time to plan and execute migrations.

WHEN deprecated code executes THEN structured warnings SHALL be emitted to logs WHERE teams can identify usage of deprecated APIs, the calling code location, and recommended alternatives.

WHEN deprecation timelines are established THEN sunset dates SHALL be clearly communicated through documentation, logs, and release notes WHERE teams know exactly when deprecated code will be removed.

WHEN multiple API versions need to coexist THEN the system SHALL support versioned exports WHERE consumers can explicitly choose which version to use during their migration period.

WHEN mechanical refactoring is possible THEN codemods SHALL be provided WHERE teams can automate syntactic transformations, reducing manual migration effort.

WHEN breaking changes are released THEN comprehensive migration guides SHALL be published WHERE step-by-step instructions, code examples, and testing strategies help teams upgrade safely.

## Success Metrics

These requirements are successfully met when:

Code duplication within shared/core is reduced by at least fifty percent as measured by static analysis tools like jscpd. Developer velocity increases, demonstrated by reduced time to implement features using shared core components, measured through sprint velocity and feature delivery metrics. System reliability improves with measurably fewer bugs originating from shared core, tracked through error monitoring systems. Onboarding time for new developers decreases by at least thirty percent as architecture becomes more intuitive and well-documented. Test coverage for shared/core reaches ninety percent with comprehensive unit and integration tests. Performance benchmarks show no regression, with cache hit rates maintaining or exceeding ninety percent and request latencies remaining under previous baselines.
