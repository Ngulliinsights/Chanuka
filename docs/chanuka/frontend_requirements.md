# Frontend Stabilization Requirements Document
**Project:** Chanuka Legislative Transparency Platform - Frontend Stabilization Initiative  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** Draft for Review

## Document Purpose

This requirements document defines the specific, testable acceptance criteria for stabilizing the Chanuka frontend application. The document uses the Enhanced EARS (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax) pattern to ensure every requirement is independently testable, traceable to implementation tasks, and free from ambiguity. Each requirement follows the structure: user story with context, followed by WHEN-THEN-WHERE acceptance criteria that specify exact trigger conditions, measurable system responses, and clear constraints.

## Project Context

The Chanuka Legislative Transparency Platform frontend currently suffers from five build-blocking errors, minimal test coverage at 6.9%, and significant type safety concerns with 31 instances of 'any' type usage. This initiative addresses these critical gaps to ensure application stability, maintainability, and deployment reliability before feature development can safely proceed.

## REQ-001: Build System Stability

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer deploying the application, I want all module resolution errors eliminated from the build process, so that deployments succeed consistently without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Criteria

**REQ-001.1 - Vite Configuration Logger Import**  
WHEN the Vite configuration file (vite.config.ts) loads during build initialization  
THEN the system SHALL successfully resolve the logger import without errors  
WHERE the import path uses either the configured path alias (@shared/utils/logger) or correct relative path (./shared/utils/logger), and the build process completes without module resolution failures related to logger dependencies.

**REQ-001.2 - Shared Schema Browser Safety**  
WHEN the client application bundles the shared schema module  
THEN the system SHALL only include browser-compatible logger code without attempting to import server-specific utilities  
WHERE the shared schema imports from shared/utils/logger (a browser-safe implementation), no Node.js-specific APIs are included in the client bundle, and tree-shaking optimizations function correctly.

**REQ-001.3 - Server Module Resolution**  
WHEN the server application initializes user profile domain logic  
THEN the system SHALL successfully resolve the cache service import without path errors  
WHERE the import path correctly references the cache service module with proper file extensions for ES modules, and server startup completes without module not found errors.

**REQ-001.4 - Build Process Success**  
WHEN executing the production build command  
THEN the system SHALL complete the build without any LSP diagnostic errors  
WHERE all TypeScript files compile successfully, all module imports resolve correctly, and the output bundle is generated in the dist directory with proper chunk splitting.

**REQ-001.5 - Development Server Startup**  
WHEN developers execute the development server command  
THEN the system SHALL start the Vite dev server within thirty seconds without errors  
WHERE hot module replacement functions correctly, all path aliases resolve properly, and the browser can load the application root without console errors related to module resolution.

**REQ-001.6 - Continuous Integration Validation**  
WHEN the CI/CD pipeline executes build verification  
THEN the system SHALL pass all build steps with zero module resolution errors  
WHERE the pipeline reports success status, build artifacts are generated correctly, and no warnings related to import paths appear in build logs.

---

## REQ-002: Type Safety Foundation

**User Story:** As a frontend developer writing API integration code, I want comprehensive TypeScript types for all API responses and error conditions, so that I catch type mismatches at compile time rather than discovering them as runtime failures in production.

### Acceptance Criteria

**REQ-002.1 - API Response Type Definitions**  
WHEN defining types for API communication in shared/types/api-responses.ts  
THEN the system SHALL provide TypeScript interfaces for all API endpoints  
WHERE each response type includes success/error discriminators, proper data payload types, optional error messages, and status codes, reducing 'any' usage in API client code to zero instances.

**REQ-002.2 - Authentication Type Safety**  
WHEN the authentication hook (use-auth.tsx) processes login, logout, or token refresh responses  
THEN the system SHALL use strongly-typed response interfaces with compile-time validation  
WHERE user objects conform to the User type from shared schema, token strings are validated as non-empty, and error responses follow the standardized ErrorResponse interface with no 'any' type usage in authentication flows.

**REQ-002.3 - Error Handler Type Guards**  
WHEN API service error handlers (services/api.ts) process caught exceptions  
THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript type guards to discriminate error types  
WHERE Error instances are detected using 'instanceof Error', network errors are identified by specific properties, and all error branches have explicit types without falling back to 'any' type annotations.

**REQ-002.4 - Type Coverage Reduction**  
WHEN analyzing TypeScript compilation across the codebase  
THEN the system SHALL reduce 'any' type usage from thirty-one instances to fewer than ten  
WHERE the remaining 'any' usages are explicitly justified with code comments, all API response handling uses proper types, event handlers specify correct event types, and utility functions declare parameter and return types explicitly.

**REQ-002.5 - Strict Mode Enablement**  
WHEN TypeScript compiles the project with strict mode enabled in tsconfig.json  
THEN the system SHALL compile without errors or suppressions  
WHERE strictNullChecks catches undefined access patterns, strictFunctionTypes prevents unsafe function assignments, noImplicitAny flags untyped variables, and noImplicitThis catches context issues in callbacks.

**REQ-002.6 - Runtime Type Validation**  
WHEN API responses arrive at runtime for critical operations  
THEN the system SHALL validate response shape matches expected types using runtime checks  
WHERE authentication responses verify required fields exist, user profile data confirms expected properties, and validation failures trigger appropriate error handling with clear error messages to users.

---

## REQ-003: Integration Test Stability

**User Story:** As a quality engineer running the test suite, I want all integration tests to execute successfully in JSDOM environment, so that I can confidently verify core user flows before deploying changes to production.

### Acceptance Criteria

**REQ-003.1 - Navigation Abstraction Layer**  
WHEN integration tests execute operations requiring browser navigation  
THEN the system SHALL use a mockable navigation service instead of direct window.location manipulation  
WHERE the navigation service provides reload and navigate methods, tests can mock these methods without JSDOM limitations, and both test and production code use the same navigation interface.

**REQ-003.2 - Test Data Attributes**  
WHEN integration tests query for UI elements in pages (not-found, profile, auth pages)  
THEN the system SHALL find elements using data-testid attributes  
WHERE every interactive element has a unique data-testid, query selectors in tests use these attributes exclusively, and tests can reliably locate elements regardless of styling or class name changes.

**REQ-003.3 - Authentication Flow Testing**  
WHEN integration tests verify the complete authentication flow (login, token storage, logout)  
THEN the system SHALL successfully execute the flow without navigation errors  
WHERE login succeeds with valid credentials using mocked API responses, authentication state persists correctly in React context, and logout clears both local state and cookies without triggering JSDOM navigation errors.

**REQ-003.4 - Profile Display Flow Testing**  
WHEN integration tests verify profile page rendering after authentication  
THEN the system SHALL successfully navigate to and render the profile page  
WHERE the profile page component appears in the document with correct data-testid, user information displays from authentication context, and the test can verify displayed values match expected user data.

**REQ-003.5 - Error Handling Flow Testing**  
WHEN integration tests verify 404 error page display for invalid routes  
THEN the system SHALL render the not-found page with appropriate error messaging  
WHERE the not-found component renders with correct data-testid attributes, error boundaries catch routing failures gracefully, and users see actionable navigation options to return to valid pages.

**REQ-003.6 - Test Suite Success Rate**  
WHEN executing the complete integration test suite  
THEN the system SHALL achieve one hundred percent test pass rate  
WHERE no tests are skipped or marked as 'todo', all assertions succeed without timeout errors, and test execution completes within five minutes for the full suite.

### Acceptance Criteria

**REQ-004.1 - Browser-Safe Logger Implementation**  
WHEN creating the shared logging utility in shared/utils/logger.ts  
THEN the system SHALL provide a browser-compatible logger with standard severity methods  
WHERE the logger exposes info, warn, error, and debug methods, each method accepts a message string plus a context object for structured data, and the implementation uses only browser-standard console APIs.

**REQ-004.2 - Console Call Elimination**  
WHEN analyzing direct console usage across client source files  
THEN the system SHALL reduce console.error and console.warn calls from one hundred fifty-three to zero  
WHERE all logging uses the structured logger instead of console methods, log calls include contextual metadata objects, and no direct console usage remains except in the logger implementation itself.

**REQ-004.3 - Contextual Metadata Standards**  
WHEN application code logs events using the structured logger  
THEN the system SHALL include consistent contextual information with every log entry  
WHERE logs specify the originating component name, include relevant entity identifiers (user ID, bill ID), capture error codes when available, and provide fallback information when using cached or default data.

**REQ-004.4 - Log Severity Appropriateness**  
WHEN reviewing logged events across the application  
THEN the system SHALL use severity levels appropriately for event significance  
WHERE errors represent failures requiring investigation, warnings indicate degraded functionality with fallbacks active, info logs track significant state transitions, and debug logs provide detailed trace information for development.

**REQ-004.5 - Production Log Volume Control**  
WHEN the application runs in production environment  
THEN the system SHALL implement log sampling to prevent performance degradation  
WHERE debug logs are completely disabled in production, info logs sample at ten percent rate for high-frequency events, warning and error logs always emit, and configuration allows runtime adjustment of sampling rates.

**REQ-004.6 - Security and Privacy Compliance**  
WHEN logging user interactions and API responses  
THEN the system SHALL exclude sensitive data from log output  
WHERE passwords and tokens never appear in logs, personally identifiable information is redacted or hashed, API keys are masked in error messages, and log output complies with data protection requirements.

WHEN executing tests for UI components in components/ui, components/bills, and components/analytics directories  
THEN the system SHALL achieve minimum seventy-five percent coverage for interactive components  
WHERE tests verify component rendering with various props, user interaction behaviors (clicks, form inputs), accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, roles), and responsive behavior across viewport sizes.

WHEN creating test utilities for component testing  
THEN the system SHALL provide a createTestProviders function that wraps components with all necessary providers  
WHERE the function accepts optional provider overrides for testing specific scenarios, default mock implementations are provided for each context, and tests can render components with minimal boilerplate setup code.

**REQ-007.3 - Provider Dependency Documentation**  
WHEN documenting provider composition order  
THEN the system SHALL create architecture decision records explaining provider dependencies  
WHERE documentation specifies which providers depend on others, explains the required nesting order (QueryClient must wrap AuthProvider, NavigationProvider must wrap ResponsiveNavigationProvider), and provides rationale for the current arrangement.

**REQ-007.4 - Performance Impact Measurement**  
WHEN measuring provider re-render performance  
THEN the system SHALL verify that provider composition doesn't introduce performance regressions  
WHERE React DevTools Profiler confirms render times remain under one hundred milliseconds, context updates only trigger necessary re-renders in subscriber components, and memoization prevents unnecessary provider re-initialization.

**REQ-007.5 - Migration Path for Existing Tests**  
WHEN updating existing tests to use composite provider pattern  
THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with current test structure  
WHERE existing tests continue passing without modifications, new tests use the simplified provider pattern, and migration can happen incrementally without requiring simultaneous updates across all test files.

**REQ-007.6 - Provider Configuration Flexibility**  
WHEN different application entry points require provider variations  
THEN the system SHALL support conditional provider inclusion based on environment  
WHERE Storybook configurations can exclude certain providers, integration tests can mock specific providers, and production builds include the complete provider stack with production configurations.
