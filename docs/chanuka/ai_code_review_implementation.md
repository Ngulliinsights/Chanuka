# Implementation Plan: AI-Generated Code Review Framework

**Project Name:** AI-Generated Code Review Framework  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Related Documents:**  
- Requirements Document (AI-Generated Code Review Framework)
- Design Document (AI-Generated Code Review Framework)

---

## Implementation Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the AI-Generated Code Review Framework into dependency-aware tasks organized across four implementation phases. Each task includes specific deliverables, success criteria, traceability to requirements, and dependencies on other tasks. The plan follows the phased approach defined in the design document, allowing incremental value delivery while managing risk and team adaptation.

The implementation uses a phase-based organization where each phase builds on previous phases and delivers tangible value independently. Phases 1-2 focus on foundational capabilities that provide immediate value through automated checks and structured review. Phases 3-4 add learning and optimization capabilities that compound effectiveness over time.

Task identifiers follow the pattern PHASE-COMPONENT-NUMBER (e.g., P1-AUTO-001) for traceability. Dependencies reference other task identifiers. Requirements references cite specific requirement IDs from the requirements document (e.g., FR-001, AC-002.3).
