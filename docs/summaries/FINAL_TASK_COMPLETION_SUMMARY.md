## üîß Additional Bug Fixes Completed

### TypeScript Error Resolution
During the task completion, identified and resolved critical TypeScript errors in the financial disclosure system:

#### Issue 1: Private Method Access
- **Problem**: Route was trying to access private `createDisclosureAlert` method
- **Solution**: Created new public `createManualAlert` method in `FinancialDisclosureIntegrationService`
- **Impact**: Proper encapsulation while maintaining functionality

#### Issue 2: Type Mismatch
- **Problem**: Alert schema included invalid `"conflict_detected"` type
- **Solution**: Updated schema to use valid `"threshold_exceeded"` type
- **Impact**: Type safety and consistency with interface definitions
