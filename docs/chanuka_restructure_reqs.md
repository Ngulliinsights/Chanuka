# Chanuka Platform Restructuring Requirements

## Document Control
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: October 12, 2025
- **Status**: Draft for Review
- **Authors**: Strategic Architecture Team

## Executive Summary

This requirements document defines the structural reorganization needed to transform the Chanuka civic engagement platform from its current fragmented state into a maintainable, scalable architecture. The restructuring addresses critical issues of code duplication, unclear ownership boundaries, and scattered cross-cutting concerns that currently impede development velocity and system reliability.

## Problem Statement

The current codebase exhibits several architectural anti-patterns that create friction for developers and risk for the platform's stability. There are multiple implementations of core infrastructure concerns like caching, error handling, and validation scattered across different directories. The separation between the docs/core experimental infrastructure and the actual server implementation creates confusion about which components are production-ready. Testing utilities are duplicated in multiple locations, making it difficult to maintain consistent quality standards. Feature boundaries are unclear, leading to tangled dependencies and difficulty in understanding system behavior.

## Strategic Goals

The restructuring must achieve five primary objectives. First, it must eliminate all redundant implementations of cross-cutting concerns, establishing single sources of truth for each infrastructure capability. Second, it must create clear architectural boundaries that make the system's structure self-documenting and intuitive for new developers. Third, it must improve testability by consolidating testing utilities and establishing clear testing patterns. Fourth, it must maintain backward compatibility during migration, ensuring zero downtime for users. Fifth, it must establish a foundation for future growth that can accommodate new features and legislative contexts without requiring additional restructuring.

## Success Criteria

The restructuring will be considered successful when all redundant implementations have been consolidated into single authoritative sources. Feature boundaries must be clear enough that new developers can locate functionality without extensive guidance. Test coverage must reach eighty percent across both frontend and backend code. API documentation must be complete and synchronized with implementation. Migration to the new structure must complete with zero user-facing incidents. Development velocity must increase as measured by story points completed per sprint. Technical debt metrics must show measurable improvement. The architecture must be capable of supporting planned feature additions without further structural changes.

## Constraints and Assumptions

This requirements document assumes that the development team has the capacity to execute a multi-phase migration over several months. It assumes that backward compatibility must be maintained throughout the migration period. It assumes that the current technology stack (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis) will remain consistent. It assumes that automated testing infrastructure exists and can be enhanced. It assumes that feature development can slow temporarily to accommodate restructuring work. It assumes that stakeholders understand the long-term value of reducing technical debt even if it temporarily reduces feature velocity.

## Traceability Matrix

Each requirement in this document will be traced through design specifications to implementation tasks. Requirements IDs (R1.1, R1.2, etc.) will be referenced in design documents, code comments, and test cases to maintain clear lineage from business need through implementation. This traceability ensures that all requirements are implemented, tested, and validated before the restructuring is considered complete.
