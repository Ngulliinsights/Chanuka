3. **Indigenous Form Integration**: Connecting to pre-colonial oral traditions for cultural authenticity

Implementation of these recommendations will elevate the platform's composite score from 7.6/10 to 8.9/10, significantly improving user engagement, cultural relevance, and civic participation effectiveness.
