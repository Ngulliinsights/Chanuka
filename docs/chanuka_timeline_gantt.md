## ⚡ DEPENDENCY MAP

### Critical Dependencies:

**Luminate → RightsCon**
- If inquiry accepted → attend RightsCon in Feb
- Use event for relationship building

**Mozilla → MozFest**
- If fellowship awarded → attend/present at MozFest
- Use for tech community credibility

**CcHUB → Africa Tech Summit**
- Attend summit regardless for networking
- Increases chances of accelerator acceptance

**FSD Kenya → KBA**
- Use FSD meeting to get KBA introduction
- Leverage FSD endorsement for banking sector

**KBA Demo → Banking Pipeline**
- Success = 43 banks in pipeline
- Failure = pivot to individual bank sales

**LSK Partnership → Law Firm Sales**
- LSK endorsement opens law firm market
- Distribution through LSK member network
