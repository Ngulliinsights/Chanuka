# **Legislative Intelligence & Relationship Mapping: The Political Economy of Law-Making in Kenya (2013–2025)**

## **1\. Executive Intelligence Summary: The Architecture of Legislative Capture**

The governance landscape of Kenya, specifically within the observation window of 2013 to 2025, presents a sophisticated, evolving ecosystem where the constitutional separation of powers is consistently tested by a symbiotic relationship between the Executive and the Legislature. This report, functioning as a "Legislative Intelligence Database," establishes a Relationship Mapping Framework that deconstructs the political economy of law-making. It posits that the legislative process in Kenya has mutated from a procedural deliberation into a complex network of interest trading, regulatory capture, and judicial evasion. The period under review is characterized by a "Legal Workaround" culture—a systemic methodology where the ruling elite utilizes statutory instruments to circumvent constitutional rigidities established by the 2010 Constitution.1

The core intelligence finding is the existence of a "Legislative-Commercial Complex." This complex operates through a nexus where Members of Parliament (MPs) serve dual roles: as oversight agents of the Executive and as commercial beneficiaries of State procurement. The data reveals a systematic pattern where legislative oversight committees (Transport, Trade, Health) are populated by individuals with direct beneficial interests in the sectors they regulate. This creates a closed-loop system where public policy is engineered to facilitate private accumulation. Specific mapping of the Roads, Sugar, and Betting sectors indicates that "conflict of interest" is not merely an ethical lapse but a structural feature of the legislative architecture.3

Furthermore, the relationship between the Legislature and the Judiciary has become the primary theater of political contestation. Following the collapse of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) under the weight of the "Basic Structure Doctrine," the Executive has shifted tactics. Rather than attempting to amend the Constitution directly—a process fraught with the risk of a referendum—the administration now deploys "Omnibus Legislation" (such as the Finance Act 2023 and the Social Health Insurance Act) to fundamentally restructure the state's social contract. When these laws are inevitably struck down by the High Court for violating principles of public participation (Article 118\) or legislative procedure (Article 110), Parliament is rapidly reconvened to pass "curative" legislation, often mimicking the nullified law but with procedural adjustments to satisfy judicial requirements.6

This report maps these dynamics through four primary vectors:

1. **Constitutional Evasion:** The systematic use of "Money Bills" to bypass Senate scrutiny and the manipulation of public participation exercises to create a veneer of legitimacy.  
2. **Judicial-Legislative Feedback Loop:** The cycle of Enactment \-\> Nullification \-\> Re-enactment (The "Cure") as seen in the Affordable Housing and SHIF sagas.  
3. **Sectoral Capture:** The direct mapping of MPs to road tenders, sugar import licenses, and betting shareholding.  
4. **Regulatory Sabotage:** The deliberate dilution of the *Conflict of Interest Bill 2023* to protect the tenderpreneurship model.

## **2\. The Constitutional Baseline: Guardrails and Interpretative Standards**

To accurately assess the deviation of current legislative practices, one must first establish the constitutional baseline. The 2010 Constitution introduced rigorous standards for law-making, centering on public participation, integrity, and the distinct roles of the two houses of Parliament. The Judiciary has developed a rich jurisprudence interpreting these provisions, often acting as the sole check on legislative excess.

### **2.1 The Public Participation Threshold (Article 10 & 118\)**

Article 10 of the Constitution lists "participation of the people" as a national value and principle of governance, while Article 118 specifically mandates Parliament to "facilitate public participation and involvement in the legislative and other business of Parliament and its committees".9 The interpretation of this mandate has been the subject of defining litigation.

In the landmark case of *British American Tobacco Kenya PLC v Cabinet Secretary for the Ministry of Health* 11, the Supreme Court provided a foundational interpretation. The court held that while public participation is mandatory, it is not a "guarantee that each individual's views will be taken as controlling." The right is one to represent one's views, not a duty of the agency to accept the view given as dispositive. However, the court emphasized that the engagement must be genuine and not "democratic theatre." The state agency or Parliament must take into consideration, in good faith, all views received.12

This standard was further refined—and arguably tightened—by the Court of Appeal in the *Finance Act 2023* litigation (*Senator Okiya Omtatah Okoiti v Cabinet Secretary for the National Treasury*). The appellate court introduced a requirement for "accountability" in the participation process. It held that it is not enough to simply collect views; Parliament must demonstrate *how* those views influenced the final Bill. Specifically, the court noted that introducing substantial amendments (such as new tax provisions) *after* the public participation phase, without subjecting those new clauses to further public scrutiny, renders the resulting law unconstitutional.13 This establishes a critical metric for legislative intelligence: **The Post-Submission Amendment Risk.** Legislation that significantly morphs between the Second Reading and the Third Reading without reverting to the public is highly vulnerable to judicial nullification. The court described this as a violation of the "spirit" of Article 10, rendering the process cosmetic.15

However, the Supreme Court's subsequent reversal of the Court of Appeal's decision in October 2024 introduced a nuance. While affirming the importance of public participation, the apex court ruled that Parliament is not expressly required by the Constitution to provide detailed reasons for accepting or rejecting every single proposal. The court seemingly reverted to the softer standard of the *BAT* case, prioritizing the "opportunity" to be heard over the "accountability" of the feedback loop. This ruling has arguably emboldened the Legislature to treat public participation as a procedural checklist rather than a substantive engagement.16

### **2.2 The Integrity Standard (Chapter Six & Mumo Matemu)**

Chapter Six of the Constitution (Leadership and Integrity) was intended to sanitize public office. The interpretative benchmark was set in *Mumo Matemu v Trusted Society of Human Rights Alliance* (2013).17 In this case, dealing with the appointment of the Chairperson of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC), the Court of Appeal laid down the principle that integrity questions are justiciable. The court held that the vetting process by Parliament is not merely a political confirmation but a legal inquiry into compliance with Chapter Six.

The *Mumo Matemu* standard dictates that appointing authorities and vetting committees must verify that a nominee meets the high moral and ethical standards required of state officers. A "clean" certificate of good conduct is insufficient if there are unresolved questions regarding a nominee's past conduct.17 Despite this clear precedent, legislative vetting committees consistently approve nominees with active criminal cases or adverse mentions in Auditor General reports, citing the presumption of innocence. This represents a deliberate "legislative lowering" of the constitutional bar, effectively rendering Chapter Six unenforceable through parliamentary processes.18

### **2.3 Pleading Precision: The *Anarita Karimi* Principle**

A recurrent tactical weapon used by the State in defending legislative capture is the principle established in *Anarita Karimi Njeru v Republic* (1979).19 This pre-2010 precedent requires a petitioner to plead their case with "reasonable precision," specifying exactly which articles of the Constitution have been violated and the manner of the violation.

In modern litigation, state counsels invoke *Anarita Karimi* to seek the dismissal of public interest petitions on technical grounds. For instance, if a petitioner challenges a law generally without linking specific sections of the Act to specific Articles of the Constitution, courts may strike out the petition. However, the Judiciary has shown an evolution. In *Mumo Matemu*, the court clarified that "precision is not coterminous with exactitude," signaling that in matters of great public interest, courts should not be shackled by procedural technicalities.19 This relaxation is vital for civil society organizations (CSOs) like Katiba Institute, which often file complex constitutional petitions challenging omnibus legislation.20

### **2.4 The Hierarchy of Legislation and the Basic Structure Doctrine**

The most significant check on legislative power remains the *Basic Structure Doctrine*, affirmed in the *BBI Judgment* (*David Ndii & Others v Attorney General*). The High Court and Court of Appeal ruled that Parliament's power to amend the Constitution is limited. Certain core features—the "Basic Structure"—cannot be altered by Parliament or even a popular initiative driven by the State; they require the exercise of primary constituent power by the people.1

This judgment effectively blocked the political elite from restructuring the Executive (creating positions like Prime Minister) through constitutional amendment. Consequently, the political strategy shifted to **statutory expansion**. If the Constitution cannot be changed to create a Prime Minister or CAS, the legislature attempts to create equivalent positions via ordinary Acts of Parliament (e.g., the *National Government Administration Laws (Amendment) Bill*), testing the limits of what can be done without touching the Constitution.22

## **3\. The Mechanism of Executive Capture: Legislative Workarounds**

The relationship between the Executive and Parliament has evolved from a theoretical check-and-balance system to a "facilitation mechanism." When the Executive encounters a constitutional blockade from the Judiciary, Parliament is deployed to legislate a bypass. This section maps the specific mechanics of this evasion.

### **3.1 The Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Saga: A Cycle of Impunity**

The creation of the office of Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) serves as a prime case study of the Executive's refusal to accept judicial limits and Parliament's complicity in enabling this defiance.

* **Phase 1: Executive Fiat:** The position was originally created by former President Uhuru Kenyatta to accommodate political allies who lost elections. It was challenged and declared unconstitutional for lack of public participation and lack of statutory backing.23  
* **Phase 2: Administrative Re-introduction:** Upon assuming office, the Kenya Kwanza administration sought to regularize the office. The Public Service Commission (PSC) conducted public participation for an initial establishment of 23 positions. However, in a move indicative of patronage pressures, the President subsequently nominated 50 individuals.24  
* **Phase 3: Judicial Strike Down:** The High Court, in *Eliud Karanja Matindi & Others v Republic*, declared the entire batch of 50 appointments unconstitutional. The court's reasoning was two-fold: First, the public participation conducted was for 23 positions, not 50; thus, the extra 27 were created without public input. Second, the office effectively duplicated the role of the Principal Secretary, violating Article 155\.23  
* **Phase 4: The Legislative Cure:** Following the court defeat, the Executive did not abandon the plan. Instead, it transmitted the *National Government Administration Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024* to Parliament. This Bill seeks to anchor the CAS position explicitly in statute, attempting to cure the "lack of statutory backing" defect cited by the courts. By passing this law, Parliament effectively "launders" the unconstitutional appointments, providing a new legal basis for the same political objective.22

**Insight:** The relationship map here shows a closed loop: Executive Action \-\> Judicial Nullification \-\> Legislative Amendment \-\> Executive Action. Parliament functions as the "clean-up crew" for Executive illegality.

### **3.2 The "Money Bill" Classification Maneuver**

A critical vulnerability in the legislative process is the abuse of the "Money Bill" classification under Article 114 of the Constitution. This article grants the National Assembly (NA) exclusive jurisdiction over bills that impose taxes or appropriate funds. However, the Executive frequently packages non-monetary policy changes within "Money Bills" to bypass the Senate.

In the *Speaker of the Senate v Attorney General* (2013) Advisory Opinion, the Supreme Court ruled that the Speaker of the National Assembly *must* consult the Speaker of the Senate to determine if a Bill concerns counties before it is introduced. If a Bill affects the functions or finances of county governments, the Senate must be involved.25

Despite this clear advisory, the National Assembly frequently ignores the concurrence step. In the *Finance Act 2023* litigation, the petitioners argued that the Act contained matters concerning counties (such as the Housing Levy and roads) and thus required Senate input. The Supreme Court, in its final judgment, had to intervene, declaring that while the main tax provisions were money bills, certain amendments—specifically to the **Kenya Roads Act** and the **Unclaimed Financial Assets Act**—were *not* incidental to a money bill and were therefore unconstitutional for lack of Senate input.6 This highlights a tactic of "Omnibus Legislation," where unrelated policy changes are hidden within Finance Bills to avoid the rigorous bicameral scrutiny that ordinary bills might face.

### **3.3 The "Stay of Execution" Tactic**

Another legislative-judicial workaround involves the timing of implementation. When a court declares a law unconstitutional (as with the Finance Act 2023 or SHIA), the State immediately applies for a "stay of execution" pending appeal. This allows the government to continue collecting taxes or implementing the voided law for months or even years while the appeal drags on. This tactic relies on the judicial philosophy that disrupting government operations is contrary to the public interest, effectively allowing unconstitutional laws to remain in force de facto, if not de jure.7

## **4\. Case Study I: The Finance Act 2023 & The Tax Wars**

The trajectory of the Finance Act 2023 provides the most comprehensive data on the interplay between the Executive, Legislature, and Judiciary in the context of fiscal policy. It reveals how the legislative process is used to impose unpopular economic measures and how the courts act as a partial, though often circumvented, brake.

### **4.1 The Housing Levy: From "Fund" to "Tax"**

Initially, the Finance Bill 2023 proposed a "Housing Fund" contribution, ostensibly a savings scheme where employees could access their contributions after a set period. However, during the legislative process, specifically at the committee stage, the nature of this contribution was fundamentally altered.

* **The Transformation:** The National Assembly's Finance and National Planning Committee, chaired by Hon. Kimani Kuria, amended the Bill to convert the "contribution" into a mandatory "levy." This removed the refundable aspect, turning it into a direct tax to fund the Affordable Housing program. Crucially, this amendment was introduced *after* the public participation phase, raising the "Post-Submission Amendment Risk" discussed earlier.29  
* **The Judicial Blockade:** The High Court, in *Okiya Omtatah*, declared the Housing Levy unconstitutional. The court found it discriminatory because it targeted only salaried employees, leaving out the informal sector, and violated Article 10 due to the lack of a proper legal framework governing the fund's expenditure.2 The court famously asked, "Why should a person in the informal sector not contribute to affordable housing?"  
* **The Legislative Fix (The Workaround):** Rather than abandoning the scheme, the Executive introduced a standalone *Affordable Housing Bill, 2023*.8 This Bill was drafted specifically to address the court's objections:  
  1. **Inclusivity:** It expanded the base to include non-salaried persons (to cure the discrimination defect), imposing a 1.5% levy on "gross income".31  
  2. **Governance:** It established the "Affordable Housing Fund" and the "Affordable Housing Board" to manage the funds, addressing the "lack of framework" argument.32  
  3. **Collection Agent:** It explicitly designated the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) as the collector, a power that was previously contested.33  
* **The Supreme Court's "White Smoke":** In October 2024, the Supreme Court overturned the Court of Appeal's decision that had nullified the entire Finance Act 2023\. The Supreme Court ruled that the legislative process *was* sufficient regarding public participation, thereby reinstating the Act. However, by this time, the Housing Levy had already been migrated to the new *Affordable Housing Act 2024*, rendering the Finance Act's housing sections moot but validating the government's procedural approach.6

### **4.2 Voting Patterns and Party Discipline**

The voting record on the Finance Bill 2023 demonstrates strict party discipline, effectively overriding constituency interests. An analysis of the Hansard and media reports indicates a clear division, with MPs voting largely along coalition lines rather than conscience.34

**Table 4.1: Voting Alignment on Finance Bill 2023 (Third Reading)**

| Voting Bloc | Key MPs (YES) | Key MPs (NO) | Rationale & Observations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Kenya Kwanza (Govt)** | **Hon. Kimani Ichung'wah** (Majority Leader) **Hon. Ndindi Nyoro** (Budget Chair) **Hon. Sylvanus Osoro** (Chief Whip) **Hon. Oscar Sudi Hon. Didmus Barasa** | **Hon. Gathoni Wamuchomba** (Githunguri) | The "Yes" bloc argued the tax was necessary for debt repayment and development. Wamuchomba was the sole vocal rebel, citing the heavy burden on "hustlers." |
| **Azimio (Opposition)** | **Hon. Farah Maalim** (Wiper) **Hon. Aden Keynan** (Jubilee) | **Hon. Opiyo Wandayi** (Minority Leader) **Hon. Babu Owino Hon. Millie Odhiambo Hon. Robert Mbui** | The "No" bloc focused on the cost of living crisis. However, significant absences (e.g., Hon. John Mbadi) facilitated the Bill's passage. |
| **Rebels/Outliers** | **Hon. Esther Passaris** (ODM \- Voted YES on Housing Levy amendments) | **Hon. Mark Mwenje** (Jubilee) | Passaris argued the Housing Levy would benefit urban slums (Nairobi). |

**Insight:** The role of the Majority Leader, Kimani Ichung'wah, was pivotal. He enforced the whip aggressively. The voting data confirms that Parliament operates effectively as a rubber stamp for Finance Bills when the Executive holds a clear majority. The committee stage, ostensibly for scrutiny, serves to sanitize the Bill before the plenary vote.36

### **4.3 Public Participation: The "Cosmetic" Exercise**

Civil society organizations, including TISA (The Institute for Social Accountability) and Okoa Uchumi, submitted extensive memoranda opposing the tax measures. They argued that the taxes would stifle economic growth and that the government should instead focus on debt restructuring and cutting recurrent expenditure.38

* **The Disregard:** Despite thousands of submissions opposing the 16% VAT on fuel and the Housing Levy, the Finance Committee retained these clauses. The Committee's report noted the objections but overruled them, citing the government's need for revenue.29  
* **Judicial Consequence:** This specific disregard was the basis for the Court of Appeal's initial finding that the participation was "cosmetic." The court noted that ignoring the vast majority of views without providing a reasoned justification violates the spirit of Article 10\.15

## **5\. Case Study II: The Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF)**

The transition from the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) to the Social Health Authority (SHA) under the *Social Health Insurance Act (SHIA)* mirrors the Housing Levy trajectory, representing a structural shift in Kenya's health financing model.

### **5.1 Legislative Intent vs. Judicial Stumbling Blocks**

The SHIA, along with the *Digital Health Act* and *Primary Health Care Act*, was enacted to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC). The key features included a mandatory 2.75% deduction from gross household income and the creation of three new funds.40 However, the legislation faced immediate legal hurdles.

* **Denial of Emergency Care:** One of the most controversial provisions was Section 26(5), which stipulated that access to healthcare services would be contingent on registration and contribution status. The High Court declared this unconstitutional, ruling that it violated Article 43 (Right to Health) and the specific constitutional guarantee that "a person shall not be denied emergency medical treatment".41  
* **Digital Privacy:** The *Digital Health Act* was challenged on grounds of data privacy, with petitioners arguing that the centralized collection of health data violated Article 31 (Right to Privacy), especially given the lack of a robust data protection impact assessment.43  
* **The 120-Day Window:** Recognizing the chaos that immediate nullification would cause, the High Court suspended its order for 120 days to allow Parliament to "repair" the unconstitutional provisions and conduct proper public participation.42

### **5.2 The Court of Appeal Stay & The "Doctrine of Necessity"**

Unlike the Housing Levy, where the Court of Appeal initially refused a stay, in the SHIF case, the Court of Appeal granted a stay of the High Court's judgment. The appellate court argued that the SHIA had repealed the NHIF Act. Therefore, if the SHIA were nullified, there would be no legal framework for health insurance in the country, creating a dangerous "vacuum" that would harm patients relying on NHIF cover.7

**Insight:** This illustrates the Judiciary's dilemma. While strict constitutionalism requires striking down flawed laws, the "doctrine of necessity" or public interest often forces courts to allow the Executive to implement flawed systems to avoid administrative collapse. This emboldens the Legislature to pass rushed, imperfect laws, calculating that the courts will be hesitant to halt them entirely due to the potential for chaos.

### **5.3 Financial Implications and Stakeholder Resistance**

The shift to a 2.75% deduction represents a significant increase in the tax burden. For a salaried employee earning KES 50,000, the deduction jumps from KES 1,200 (NHIF) to KES 1,375. For higher earners (e.g., KES 200,000), it jumps to KES 5,500.

* **Stakeholders:** The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) and the Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE) opposed the rate, arguing it reduces disposable income and increases the cost of employment.44  
* **Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) Analysis:** The IEA pointed out that the new scheme risked being regressive and that the "means testing" for the informal sector (to determine their 2.75% contribution) was administratively complex and prone to errors.45

## **6\. Relationship Mapping I: The Roads & Infrastructure Cartel**

The most critical component of this "Legislative Intelligence" report is the mapping of conflicts of interest. The barrier between "State Officer" and "Private Contractor" is porous, with MPs frequently holding beneficial interests in the sectors they oversight. The roads sector is a primary locus of this conflict.

### **6.1 The Conflict: MPs as Contractors**

The Auditor General and EACC have consistently flagged instances where companies associated with MPs receive tenders from agencies like the Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA) and Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA).

* **The Mechanism:** MPs sit on the **Departmental Committee on Transport and Infrastructure**. This committee oversights the Ministry of Roads and approves its budget. Simultaneously, MPs exercise significant influence over the constituency roads committees that determine which projects KeRRA undertakes.  
* **The Findings:** An EACC inquiry (Inquiry No. EACC/FI/INQ/34/2022) specifically investigated allegations of conflict of interest against a "Member of Parliament for Ikolomani Constituency" regarding tenders awarded to a proxy company at KeRRA, KWS, and KURA.5  
* **Pending Bills & Liquidity:** MPs frequently pressure the Cabinet Secretary (CS) for Roads to release funds for "pending bills." The data reveals that a significant portion of these pending bills are owed to companies where MPs or their proxies have interests. During a parliamentary session, CS Davis Chirchir informed the House that 40% of outstanding payments would be released, a move largely seen as appeasing MPs who were threatening to block other government business.46

### **6.2 The Battle for the Road Maintenance Levy Fund (RMLF)**

A fierce political battle has raged over the **Road Maintenance Levy Fund (RMLF)**, a fuel levy used to maintain roads.

* **The Combatants:** The Council of Governors (CoG) vs. Members of Parliament.  
* **The Issue:** Governors demanded that a portion of the RMLF be devolved directly to counties for county roads. MPs vehemently opposed this, insisting that the funds remain under KeRRA.  
* **The Motivation:** KeRRA projects are heavily influenced by MPs (Constituency Roads Committees), whereas County funds are controlled by Governors. MPs threatened to block the *County Governments Additional Allocations Bill, 2025* unless Governors withdrew a court case seeking the funds.4  
* **Intelligence Insight:** This is a direct battle for control of procurement opportunities. MPs prioritize the KeRRA model because it allows them to steer contracts to friendly firms, maintaining their patronage networks.

### **6.3 Profile: Hon. Didmus Barasa & CDF Misuse**

Hon. Didmus Barasa (Kimilili MP) exemplifies the blurring of lines between public resources and political campaigning.

* **The Incident:** In 2022, a government vehicle belonging to the Kimilili NG-CDF (National Government Constituencies Development Fund) was found branded with United Democratic Alliance (UDA) campaign colors and the MP's portrait. The registration plate had been changed.48  
* **The Implication:** This demonstrates the proprietary attitude some MPs have towards CDF assets. The CDF is effectively treated as a personal campaign war chest.  
* **Audit Queries:** Barasa has also faced audit queries regarding the "shoddy workmanship" of schools built with CDF funds in his constituency, highlighting the lack of quality control when contracts are awarded based on patronage rather than merit.49

## **7\. Relationship Mapping II: The Sugar & Betting Syndicates**

Beyond infrastructure, the legislative capture extends to the regulation of specific commodities and high-revenue industries.

### **7.1 The Sugar Sector: Policy Capture and "Condemned Sugar"**

The sugar industry in Kenya has historically been a site of state capture, with policy decisions directly benefiting a cartel of importers often linked to the legislature.

* **The Import Scandal (2018):** Following a drought, the Treasury opened a duty-free window for sugar importation. A parliamentary report later revealed that companies associated with MPs and senior government officials were major beneficiaries. Specifically, the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture and Trade was accused of producing a "sanitized" report that protected key cabinet secretaries (Henry Rotich, Adan Mohammed) and implicated importers.50  
* **The "Condemned Sugar" Saga (2023):** In 2023, 20,000 bags of sugar that had been condemned by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) as unfit for consumption were irregularly released and sold to the public. The sugar was ostensibly meant for conversion into ethanol.  
  * **The Actors:** The investigation implicated agencies like KRA, KEBS, and the Agriculture and Food Authority (AFA).  
  * **Legislative Cover:** The National Assembly's *Trade, Industry and Cooperatives Committee*, chaired by **Hon. James Gakuya**, investigated the matter. However, critics argued that the committee's recommendations were weak and failed to hold the ultimate beneficiaries accountable, focusing instead on mid-level bureaucrats.3  
  * **Beneficial Ownership:** Reports suggest that the companies involved in the importation (e.g., those linked to the Rai family or political proxies) have deep ties to the political class, explaining the reluctance of Parliament to enforce strict penalties.52

### **7.2 The Betting Sector: SportPesa & Legislative Lobbying**

The taxation of the betting industry reveals the power of corporate lobbying within Parliament.

* **The Tax Wars:** In 2019, the government introduced a 20% excise tax on betting stakes, driving major players like SportPesa out of the market. The argument was to curb gambling addiction.53  
* **Shareholder MPs:** Investigative reports, such as the "Finance Uncovered" expose, revealed that the ownership structure of SportPesa included politically exposed persons (PEPs). Specifically, links were drawn to relatives of high-ranking executive officials and MPs.54  
* **Legislative Reversal:** Following the 2019 crackdown, MPs began lobbying for a review of the tax regime. Arguments regarding "support for sports" and "loss of revenue" were advanced in the Finance Committee. By the Finance Act 2023, while taxes remained, the regulatory environment had stabilized, allowing the return of major operators. The voting patterns on betting taxes often correlate with MPs who receive "sponsorship" for local sports tournaments from these firms.55

## **8\. The Conflict of Interest Legislation Paradox**

The legislative history of the *Conflict of Interest Bill, 2023* encapsulates the Parliament's profound reluctance to self-regulate. It serves as the ultimate proof of the "Legislative-Commercial Complex."

### **8.1 The Bill's Intent**

The Bill was sponsored by the government (backed by the EACC) to replace the weak *Public Officer Ethics Act*. Its primary goal was to cure the loopholes that allow state officers to trade with the government.

* **Key Provisions (Original):**  
  * **Mandatory Declaration:** Of income, assets, and liabilities for public officers *and* their spouses/dependents.  
  * **Prohibition:** Explicitly forbidding public officers from entering into contracts with any public entity.  
  * **Blind Trusts:** Requiring public officers to place business assets in blind trusts during their tenure.56

### **8.2 The Parliamentary Mutilation**

Upon reaching the National Assembly, the Bill was committed to the **Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC)**. Here, it underwent significant "surgery."

* **Redefining "Family":** The committee amended the definition of "family" to exclude distant relatives or associates. This is a critical loophole, as most corruption is conducted through proxies (cousins, in-laws) rather than spouses.37  
* **Reporting Authority:** The Bill originally empowered the EACC to be the central repository for wealth declarations. Parliament amended this to make the "Reporting Authority" for MPs the **Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC)**. Essentially, MPs voted to report their wealth to themselves, removing independent oversight.36  
* **EACC Powers:** The committee stripped the EACC of the power to demand the forfeiture of unexplained assets directly, requiring a more convoluted court process.37  
* **Senate Mediation:** The Bill is currently in mediation between the two houses. However, the version that is likely to pass is a "watered-down" variant that protects the status quo. The refusal to pass a stringent law confirms that the ability to trade with the state is viewed by MPs as a perk of the office.57

## **9\. Profile of Key Legislative Operators**

To understand the legislative outcomes, one must profile the key operators who manage the floor and committees.

### **9.1 Hon. Kimani Ichung'wah (Leader of Majority)**

* **Role:** The "Enforcer." As Majority Leader, he is the primary conduit for Executive policy in the House.  
* **Tactics:** He uses the Standing Orders aggressively to limit debate time and whip members into line. His role in the *Conflict of Interest Bill* was pivotal; he moved the amendments that diluted the strict provisions, arguing they were "punitive".37 He is also the face of the Finance Acts, defending the Housing Levy with unwavering loyalty to the party manifesto.

### **9.2 Hon. Gladys Boss Shollei (Deputy Speaker)**

* **Background:** Former Chief Registrar of the Judiciary. Her past involves a high-profile dismissal and subsequent acquittal on corruption charges.58  
* **Legislative Role:** As Deputy Speaker and Chairperson of the **Committee on Delegated Legislation**, she holds immense power over statutory instruments (regulations). This committee determines whether regulations (like the Housing Levy Regulations or SHIF Regulations) become law.  
* **Significance:** She represents the "politicization of legal expertise." She uses her deep knowledge of judicial processes to navigate legislative hurdles for the ruling party. She also sponsored the *Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill* regarding the gender rule, showing her influence on constitutional matters.60

### **9.3 Hon. Oscar Sudi (Kapseret MP)**

* **The Power Broker:** Sudi is rarely heard in parliamentary debates (Hansard records show minimal contributions). However, his influence is immense. He is a key confidant of the President and a major business operator in the Rift Valley.  
* **The Nexus:** He represents the "commercialization of politics." His power stems from his ability to mobilize resources and his network of companies (linked to logistics and infrastructure). He exemplifies the MP whose primary activity is deal-making rather than law-making.61

## **10\. Conclusion: The State of Legislative Intelligence**

The relationship mapping of Kenya's legislative landscape (2013-2025) reveals a system in high-tension equilibrium.

* **The Parliament** has largely been captured by the Executive through a combination of strict party discipline and the commercial co-optation of individual MPs. The "oversight" function has been replaced by a "transactional" relationship where legislative support is traded for development funds (NG-CDF) and procurement opportunities (Roads).  
* **The Judiciary** acts as the primary opposition, striking down laws on procedural grounds. However, the Executive has developed a "counter-strategy" involving the immediate re-enactment of annulled laws (The "Cure") and the use of "stays of execution" to keep unconstitutional regimes in place.  
* **The Commercial Nexus:** The refusal to pass a robust Conflict of Interest law is the smoking gun. It confirms that the political class views the state primarily as a site for extraction.

Future Outlook:  
Expect the "Act-Levy-Act" cycle to continue. As the government seeks to raise revenue through unpopular measures (like SHIF and Housing Levy), the courts will continue to be the battleground. The Basic Structure Doctrine remains the ultimate shield against a complete constitutional overhaul, but statutory encroachments (like the CAS Bill) will chip away at the 2010 constitutional order.
