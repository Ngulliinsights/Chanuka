## Platform Overview

### Mission and Vision

Chanuka is a comprehensive civic engagement platform designed to empower Kenyan citizens with transparent access to legislative processes, expert analysis, and community-driven insights. The platform serves as a digital commons where citizens can discover, analyze, and engage with legislation while building collective understanding of democratic processes.

### Core Architecture

The Chanuka platform is built on a domain-driven architecture with 12 specialized domains:

- **Client Application**: React-based frontend with progressive disclosure and accessibility features
- **Server Application**: Domain-driven backend with specialized modules
- **Shared Code**: Common utilities and type definitions
- **AI Models & Knowledge Base**: Constitutional and legal analysis capabilities
- **Deployment & Infrastructure**: Kubernetes-based scalable deployment

### Key Features

- **Constitutional Analysis**: AI-powered analysis of legislation against constitutional provisions
- **Real-time Engagement**: Live community participation and expert validation
- **Expert Verification**: Credibility scoring and professional validation system
- **Transparency Intelligence**: Conflict detection and financial disclosure analysis
- **Pretext Detection**: Democratic protection through pattern recognition
- **Universal Access**: USSD and ambassador programs for broad accessibility

### Philosophical Foundation

Chanuka draws on deep philosophical and scriptural traditions, particularly the biblical progression from singular leadership (Moses) through distributed systems (seventy elders) to universal participation (Pentecost). This foundation emphasizes that sustainable civic engagement requires distributing power and capacity throughout communities rather than concentrating it in singular leaders.

The platform's poetry collection, "Illuminations: Twenty Poems for a Fragile Republic," serves as both artistic expression and civic education, addressing themes of co-optation, confusion, vision, and resistance in contemporary Kenyan democracy.

### Strategic Messaging

The platform's messaging emphasizes:
- **Democratic Awakening**: Moving citizens from passive observers to active participants
- **Truth as Action**: Civic engagement as the antidote to democratic fragility
- **Distributed Leadership**: Power multiplied through community rather than concentrated in elites
- **Hope Through Action**: Practical steps for citizens to reclaim democratic agency
