# **Political Pragmatism and the Constitutional Dialectic in Kenya: Judicial Craft, Legislative Realism, and the Culture of Justification**

## **1\. Introduction: The Unfinished Transformation and the Crisis of Justification**

The promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya in 2010 represented a seismic shift in the nation’s legal and political topography, a moment frequently described by scholars and jurists as the inauguration of a "transformative" constitutional order.1 This document was not merely a revised set of rules for the allocation of government power; it was a deliberate, remedial intervention designed to dismantle the "culture of authority" that had defined the post-independence state—characterized by executive impunity, opacity, and the centralization of power—and replace it with a "culture of justification".3 Under this new dispensation, the validity of any exercise of public power depends not on the rank or status of the actor, but on their ability to provide substantive, rational, and constitutional justifications for their actions.5

However, more than a decade into this transformative project, the constitutional landscape is defined less by the seamless implementation of these ideals and more by a fierce, dialectical struggle between the normative aspirations of the text and the gritty "legislative realism" of the political class.7 This report offers an exhaustive analysis of this tension. It posits that the Kenyan Judiciary is currently engaged in a high-stakes jurisprudential experiment, navigating a treacherous path between asserting "strong-form" judicial review—striking down constitutional amendments and major fiscal statutes—and employing "political pragmatism" through remedial crafting to prevent institutional collapse.8

Simultaneously, the Legislature and Executive have evolved sophisticated mechanisms of "state capture" and "colourable legislation" to bypass these constitutional constraints, utilizing the guise of public participation and "miscellaneous amendments" to entrench policy decisions that serve elite interests rather than the public good.10 Through a detailed examination of landmark jurisprudence—ranging from the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) to the Finance Act 2023—and an analysis of the theoretical underpinnings of Kenyan constitutionalism, this report argues that the survival of the rule of law in Kenya depends on the Judiciary's evolving capacity to detect legislative pretext and enforce the "duty to give reasons" as a bulwark against the capture of the state.

## **2\. Theoretical Frameworks: The Academy and the Bench**

To understand the practical maneuvers of Kenyan courts and legislators, one must first dissect the theoretical frameworks that inform their actions. The Kenyan judiciary does not operate in a vacuum; its "judicial craft" is deeply influenced by specific academic debates regarding transformative constitutionalism, the separation of powers, and the nature of judicial review.

### **2.1 The Shift from Authority to Justification**

The foundational philosophy underpinning post-2010 Kenyan jurisprudence is the concept of a "culture of justification." Originally coined by Etienne Mureinik in the context of South Africa’s transition from apartheid, this concept has been inextricably woven into Kenyan legal thought.4 In the pre-2010 era, or the "culture of authority," the government could essentially command obedience based solely on its sovereignty. The burden of proof lay heavily on the citizen to show that the state had acted *ultra vires* or irrationally, a threshold that was nearly impossible to meet given the "ouster clauses" that shielded executive action from review.1

Under the 2010 Constitution, specifically through the interplay of Article 10 (National Values) and Article 24 (Limitation of Rights), the burden shifts. The state must affirmatively justify its actions. As noted in the *Finance Act* litigation, Article 10(2)(c) mandates accountability and transparency, creating an obligation for state organs to explain not just *what* they decided, but *why* they decided it, and crucially, why they rejected alternative views.3 This shift is radical because it subjects the *motive* and *reasoning* of the political branches to judicial scrutiny, a domain previously considered "non-justiciable" under the political question doctrine.

### **2.2 Gathii’s "Incomplete Transformation" and the Two-Track Judiciary**

Professor James Thuo Gathii provides a critical lens for evaluating the judiciary's performance in this new era. Gathii argues that the transformation envisaged by the 2010 Constitution remains "incomplete," threatened by the persistence of a "two-tracked" system of judicial review.12

* **Track One (Transformative):** This track embraces the "strong-form" judicial review empowered by Article 165\. Judges on this track employ purposive interpretation, piercing the corporate veil of the state to protect substantive rights. This is evident in the *BBI* and *Okoiti* (DMS) judgments, where courts refused to defer to executive narratives.8  
* **Track Two (Conservative/Formalist):** This track is a residue of the common law tradition and the pre-2010 judiciary. It relies on technicalities, procedural bars, and extreme deference to the executive to dismiss petitions. Gathii highlights early election petition cases where courts dismissed suits because documents were served to a respondent's wife rather than the respondent personally, ignoring the substantive justice of the election dispute.1

Gathii advocates for a "rational basis review" that is distinct from the American weak-form version. He argues that Kenyan courts should ensure legislative and executive actions are *rationally connected* to legitimate governmental purposes.5 This, he posits, allows the judiciary to uphold constitutional supremacy without necessarily usurping the policy-making role of the other branches. However, critics argue that "rational basis review" may be too deferential for a context rife with "state capture," where the "rational connection" is often a pretext for corrupt intent.13

### **2.3 Walter Khobe and the "Derivative Jurisdiction"**

Further complicating the theoretical landscape is the work of scholar Walter Khobe, who has extensively analyzed the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Khobe argues for a "derivative jurisdiction," suggesting that the Supreme Court's power is not strictly limited to the appellate mechanisms explicitly listed in the text but is derived from its role as the ultimate guardian of the Constitution's transformative ethos.14

Khobe posits that the Kenyan Constitution is "post-liberal"—it is social, redistributive, and actively seeks to dismantle the public/private divide that traditionally shielded private power (and state capture actors) from human rights scrutiny.15 This theoretical stance supports a more activist judiciary that does not shy away from "political questions" when those questions impinge on the foundational values of the state. Khobe’s analysis of "judicial craft" suggests that judges must be acutely aware of the "politics of law" and the need to develop jurisprudence that is resilient to executive backlash while remaining principled.14

### **2.4 The Counter-Majoritarian Dilemma in Kenya**

The "counter-majoritarian difficulty"—the legitimacy crisis arising when unelected judges overturn the will of elected representatives—is particularly acute in Kenya. Political elites frequently accuse the judiciary of "judicial activism" or "legislating from the bench".16 To navigate this, Kenyan judges have developed a form of "transformative prudentialism." This involves a strategic calibration of their judgments: they may strike down a popular political project (like BBI) on *procedural* grounds (the "popular initiative" flaw) rather than substantive ones, or they may invalidate a tax law (Finance Act) but *suspend* the order to allow the government to "fix" the error.9 This "prudentialism" is not a retreat from the Constitution but a pragmatic strategy to ensure the judiciary survives to fight another day.

## **3\. The Architecture of Judicial Review: Doctrines and Mechanisms**

The theoretical shift to a "culture of justification" has necessitated the development of specific doctrinal tests and mechanisms of review. Kenyan courts have moved beyond the traditional *Wednesbury* unreasonableness test (which set a very high bar for overturning government action) to more probing standards of review, including proportionality and the "basic structure" doctrine.

### **3.1 The Death of the "Political Question" Doctrine**

Historically, Kenyan courts adhered to the "political question doctrine," a principle of judicial self-restraint where courts declined to adjudicate matters deemed to be the exclusive domain of the Executive or Legislature (e.g., foreign policy, military deployment, or the internal workings of Parliament).18 This doctrine was often used to shield the imperial presidency from scrutiny.

The 2010 Constitution, however, fundamentally altered this. Article 165(3)(d) grants the High Court jurisdiction to hear "any question respecting the interpretation of this Constitution," effectively eliminating the "law-free zones" where politics could operate unchecked.20

* **Justiciability of the "Political":** In the *BBI* litigation, the Attorney General argued that the President’s decision to initiate a constitutional amendment was a political choice rooted in his role as a unifier. The courts rejected this, holding that while the *motivation* might be political, the *process* is constitutional and therefore justiciable. The Court asserted that "politics must be conducted within the constitutional framework," and courts have a duty to enforce "constitutional morality" even in the political sphere.8  
* **Foreign Deployment:** The doctrine was further eroded in cases challenging the deployment of the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) to Somalia and Haiti. Courts have held that the Executive must strictly comply with Article 240 and seek Parliamentary approval, and that the court has the jurisdiction to review whether that approval was meaningful or a rubber stamp.21

### **3.2 Proportionality and the Modified *Oakes* Test**

When the state limits a constitutional right—whether it is the right to privacy (DMS case), freedom of association (LGBTQ case), or property (Finance Act)—it must justify this limitation under Article 24 of the Constitution. Kenyan courts have adopted a modified version of the *Oakes* test from Canadian jurisprudence to operationalize this article.22

The test proceeds in four stages:

1. **Legitimate Objective:** Does the law or action serve a pressing and substantial public interest?  
2. **Rational Connection:** Is the measure rationally connected to that objective? (It must not be arbitrary).  
3. **Minimal Impairment:** Does the measure impair the right *as little as possible* to achieve the objective? (Are there less restrictive alternatives?).  
4. **Proportionality Strictu Sensu:** Do the benefits of the measure outweigh the harm to the right?

Application in the Okoiti (DMS) Case:  
In Okoiti v. Communications Authority of Kenya, the state sought to install a "Device Management System" (DMS) to access mobile subscriber data, citing the objective of combating counterfeit phones.23

* *Objective:* The court accepted that fighting counterfeits was legitimate.  
* *Rational Connection:* The court questioned whether mass surveillance of *all* devices was rationally connected to finding *counterfeit* ones.  
* *Minimal Impairment:* This was the fatal blow. The court found that the Authority already had a database of IMEI numbers and could block counterfeits without accessing subscriber data or listening to calls. The DMS was a sledgehammer used to crack a nut.  
* *Conclusion:* The measure failed the proportionality test and was declared unconstitutional.24

### **3.3 The "Basic Structure" Doctrine**

The *BBI* judgment introduced the "Basic Structure Doctrine"—originating from the Indian Supreme Court case *Kesavananda Bharati*—into Kenyan jurisprudence. This doctrine holds that there are certain "eternal" or "core" features of the Constitution (such as the separation of powers, the independence of the judiciary, and the sovereignty of the people) that cannot be amended even by a supermajority of Parliament, or can only be amended through a highly specific, onerous process involving a referendum and genuine popular initiation.8

While the Supreme Court of Kenya ultimately held that the doctrine *as applied in India* (where courts can strike down amendments entirely) was not fully applicable due to Kenya's specific amendment history, they affirmed a version of it: that the "Basic Structure" is protected by the *process* of amendment. The President cannot use the "Popular Initiative" route (Article 257\) intended for citizens to alter the basic structure; to do so is a "fraud on the constitution".8 This nuanced application demonstrates judicial craft—avoiding a total lock-in of the constitution while preventing executive abuse of the amendment process.

## **4\. Legislative Realism: The Craft of Pretext and Capture**

While the judiciary has been developing doctrines of justification, the Legislature and Executive have been refining the art of "legislative realism." This involves the use of "colourable legislation," pretextual policy-making, and procedural maneuvering to bypass constitutional constraints and facilitate "state capture."

### **4.1 The Doctrine of Colourable Legislation**

"Colourable legislation" refers to statutes that appear constitutional on their face—ostensibly addressing a legitimate subject—but are actually designed to achieve an unconstitutional objective indirectly. The guiding maxim is *“what cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly”*.26

The CDF Saga:  
The evolution of the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) is the archetypal example.

1. **CDF Act 2013:** The Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional because it violated the division of powers (Legislators were implementing projects, which is an Executive function) and the principles of devolution.9  
2. **NG-CDF Act 2015:** Parliament, anticipating the ruling, enacted the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF) Act. They argued this was a "new" fund distinct from the old one.  
3. **Judicial Response:** Litigants argued this was "old wine in new bottles"—a colourable attempt to retain control over development funds (a key patronage tool) despite the court's ruling. The courts have struggled with this, striking it down again, only for Parliament to attempt further "tweaks," creating a cycle of litigation and re-enactment.9

### **4.2 State Capture and "Budgeted Corruption"**

The analysis of legislative realism is incomplete without integrating the concept of "state capture," as extensively documented by the Africa Centre for Open Governance (AfriCOG). State capture in Kenya is not merely about bribery; it is a systemic project where the machinery of the state—including the law-making process—is repurposed for private profiteering.7

"Budgeted Corruption":  
Former Auditor General Edward Ouko described the national budget as a "highway" with "exit lanes" created specifically for theft. The report Highway Robbery details how this works:

* **Inflation of Costs:** Infrastructure projects are budgeted at inflated rates during the parliamentary appropriation phase.  
* **Earmarked Theft:** The excess funds are not meant for the project but are "budgeted corruption"—money legally allocated but intended for diversion.10  
* **Legislative Complicity:** Parliament, which has the power of the purse, facilitates this by passing Appropriations Acts that contain these "exit lanes," often in exchange for patronage or lack of oversight.27

This phenomenon renders the "presumption of constitutionality" problematic. When a court assumes a budget law is passed for the "public good," it may be ignoring the reality that the law serves a "capture" purpose.

### **4.3 The "Miscellaneous Amendment" Trojan Horse**

A favored tactic of the Executive to bypass scrutiny is the "Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill." Historically, these bills were used for minor, non-controversial corrections (e.g., fixing typos or updating definitions). However, in recent years, they have been used to introduce substantive, controversial policy changes.11

Case Study: The Judicial Service Act Amendments:  
The government attempted to use a Miscellaneous Amendment Bill to alter the composition of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) and the NGO Coordination Board.

* **The Strategy:** By burying these changes in a massive omnibus bill, the Executive hoped to avoid the specialized scrutiny and public debate that a standalone "JSC Amendment Bill" would attract.  
* **The Challenge:** Katiba Institute and the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) challenged this practice. The High Court ruled that using a Miscellaneous Bill for substantive amendments limits public participation and violates Article 118, as the public cannot reasonably be expected to identify major policy shifts hidden in a "corrections" bill.28

### **4.4 Legislative Impunity and the Gender Rule**

Legislative realism also manifests as "legislative impunity"—the refusal of Parliament to act even when constitutionally mandated. The most glaring example is the "two-thirds gender rule" (Article 27). Despite a clear constitutional timeline and multiple court orders, Parliament failed to enact legislation to ensure no more than two-thirds of its members are of the same gender.29

* **The Consequence:** Chief Justice David Maraga advised the President to dissolve Parliament for this failure (Article 261).  
* **The Reaction:** Parliament and the Executive ignored the advice, and the "capture" of the political system ensured that the President faced no real consequence for this defiance. This illustrates the limits of judicial power when confronted with a united front of legislative and executive intransigence.29

## **5\. The Battleground of Public Participation**

Public participation (Article 118\) has evolved from a procedural formality into the primary battleground for constitutional litigation in Kenya. It is the mechanism through which the "culture of justification" attacks the "culture of authority."

### **5.1 From "Check-Box" to "Duty to Give Reasons"**

Historically, state organs treated public participation as a "check-box" exercise—holding a few town halls, collecting memoranda, and then ignoring them to pass the law as originally intended.30 The *Finance Act 2023* judgment by the Court of Appeal fundamentally altered this landscape by introducing the **"Duty to Give Reasons"**.3

The New Standard (The "Culture of Justification" Checklist):  
For public participation to be constitutionally valid, the Court of Appeal held that Parliament must demonstrate:

1. **Notice and Access:** The public was given adequate notice and access to the *actual* text of the Bill.3  
2. **Qualitative Engagement:** The engagement was not just quantitative (counting memoranda) but qualitative (analyzing content).  
3. **Feedback Loop:** Crucially, Parliament must explain *why* it accepted certain views and *why* it rejected others.  
   * *Pretext Detection:* If Parliament rejects a view that is empirically sound (e.g., data showing a tax will destroy an industry) without a rational reason, the court can infer that the participation was a sham and the law is arbitrary.3

This requirement forces the Legislature to show its work. It prevents the "vanishing people" phenomenon, where the citizen's voice disappears the moment the public hearing ends.3

### **5.2 The "Sneaked Amendments" and the Committee Stage**

A recurring tactic exposed in the *Finance Act* litigation is the "sneaked amendment."

* **The Tactic:** Parliament publishes a Bill, subjects it to public participation, and then, at the "Committee Stage" (Third Reading), introduces entirely *new* clauses that were never in the original draft.  
* **The Finance Act 2023 Example:** The Court found that 18 new provisions—including taxes on digital assets—were added at the Committee stage. The public never had a chance to comment on them.11  
* **Judicial Ruling:** The Court of Appeal termed these "mischievously sneaked" amendments. It ruled that if a Bill is substantially altered after public participation, it must go back to the public. You cannot use the "amendment power" to introduce new policy that bypasses the people.11

### **5.3 The Finance Act 2023: A Case Study in "Fraud on the Constitution"**

The litigation surrounding the Finance Act 2023 serves as the perfect microcosm of the clash between legislative realism and judicial scrutiny.

**Table 1: The Finance Act 2023 Litigation Timeline**

| Stage | Action | Key Argument/Outcome |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Legislative Drafting** | Bill introduced with Housing Levy, VAT hikes. | **Executive:** Necessary for debt sustainability. |
| **Public Participation** | Thousands of memoranda submitted opposing taxes. | **Civil Society:** Taxes are regressive; Housing Levy is discriminatory. |
| **Committee Stage** | Parliament ignores most objections; adds 18 *new* clauses. | **Parliament:** "We have the power to amend laws." |
| **High Court Ruling** | Declared Housing Levy unconstitutional (discriminatory); saved rest of Act. | **Reasoning:** "Pith and Substance" doctrine—Act is a Money Bill, Senate input not needed. |
| **Court of Appeal** | Declared **ENTIRE** Act unconstitutional. | **Reasoning:** "Sneaked" amendments violated Art. 118\. Failure to "give reasons" for rejecting public views rendered the process a sham.3 |
| **Supreme Court** | **Stayed** the invalidity pending final appeal. | **Pragmatism:** Immediate invalidation would cause fiscal collapse. |

This saga demonstrates that "Fraud on the Constitution"—via sham participation and procedural shortcuts—is now a central ground for judicial review, distinct from substantive rights violations.

## **6\. The BBI Judgment: A Jurisprudential Earthquake**

The judgment on the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) is arguably the most significant decision in Kenya's history regarding the limits of political pragmatism. It was a direct confrontation between the Judiciary and the "Deep State."

### **6.1 Context: The Handshake and the "Unity" Pretext**

The BBI was born out of a "Handshake" between President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga. Ostensibly aimed at "unifying" the country, the resulting constitutional amendment bill sought to expand the Executive (reintroducing a Prime Minister) and create an Ombudsman for the Judiciary (threatening judicial independence).8

### **6.2 Piercing the Veil of the "Popular Initiative"**

The promoters of BBI attempted to use Article 257 (Amendment by Popular Initiative), which is designed for citizens to initiate change. They collected millions of signatures to bypass the constraints of a Parliamentary initiative (Article 256).

* **The Pretext:** The state machinery (Chiefs, County Commissioners) was used to collect signatures, yet the bill was presented as a "Wanjiku" (common citizen) initiative.  
* **The Ruling:** The High Court and Supreme Court pierced this veil. They made a finding of fact that the President was the *promoter*. As the President is not a "popular initiative" actor, the entire process was declared unconstitutional. This was a direct strike against "state capture" of the amendment process.8

### **6.3 The Basic Structure Doctrine and the Seven Opinions**

The Supreme Court's decision was not unanimous on all points, revealing the nuance of judicial thought.

* **The Majority (CJ Koome, Mwilu DCJ, et al.):** Held that the Basic Structure doctrine is not applicable in Kenya in the *Indian sense* (courts striking down amendments based on content), but affirmed that the *process* protects the basic structure. The President cannot initiate a popular amendment.8  
* **The Nuance:** The Court effectively reserved the power to review future amendments if they threatened the core of the constitutional order, even if they declined to fully embrace the Indian doctrine. This leaves a "loaded gun" on the table for future defense of the constitution.

## **7\. Judicial Remedies: Navigating the Vacuum**

The most distinct feature of Kenyan "judicial craft" is the development of remedies that balance legal principle with political stability.

### **7.1 Suspended Declarations of Invalidity**

In the *Finance Act* and *CDF Act* cases, the courts declared the laws unconstitutional but suspended the effect of the ruling for a period (e.g., 45 days or 12 months).9

**Table 2: The Logic and Critique of Suspended Invalidity**

| Perspective | Argument | Implications |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Judicial Pragmatism** | Immediate invalidation creates a legal/fiscal vacuum (e.g., no tax collection, no bursaries). Suspension allows Parliament to "fix" the error. | Maintains institutional comity; prevents chaos. |
| **Constitutional Purism** | A law that violates the Constitution is void *ab initio* (from the start). Suspending judgment gives "legal force to a nullity." | Incentivizes "try and see" legislation; Government keeps collecting illegal taxes.35 |
| **Civic Critique (Nyawa)** | This amounts to "Judicial complicity" in illegality. It undermines the rule of law by allowing the state to benefit from its own wrongdoing. | Dilutes the "strong-form" review power.36 |

### **7.2 Structural Interdicts (Continuous Mandamus)**

To deal with recalcitrant state actors who ignore court orders (particularly in land and housing rights cases), Kenyan courts are exploring "structural interdicts." This involves the court keeping a file open and requiring the government to report back periodically on its compliance.37

* **Example:** In *Mitu-Bell Welfare Society v. KAA*, the Supreme Court affirmed the power of courts to issue such orders to supervise evictions and ensure alternate housing is provided. This moves the court from a "one-off" adjudicator to a continuous supervisor of administrative justice.2

## **8\. Sectoral Analysis: Land, Privacy, and Morality**

### **8.1 Land Justice and Ambreena Manji's Analysis**

The "land question" remains the dark heart of Kenyan politics. Professor Ambreena Manji argues that the "struggle for land and justice" is the primary arena where the 2010 Constitution's transformative promise meets the resistance of the colonial and post-colonial elite.38

* **The National Land Commission (NLC):** Designed to strip the President of the power to allocate land (a key patronage tool), the NLC has been systematically undermined by the Executive through budget cuts and parallel legislation (e.g., the Land Laws Amendment Act), a classic case of "state capture" via legislative counter-reform.40  
* **Judicial Role:** Courts have had to adjudicate historical land injustices, often ruling against the state. However, the enforcement of these judgments is notoriously difficult, leading to the "paper victory" phenomenon for displaced communities.41

### **8.2 Surveillance and the "Sealed Cover"**

In the *DMS case* and the *Huduma Namba* litigation, the state attempted to use "national security" as a shield to prevent scrutiny of surveillance technologies.

* **The "Sealed Cover":** The state often seeks to provide evidence only to the judge, excluding the petitioners. Critics argue this practice—common in India—is a "fraud on the constitution" in the Kenyan context of transparency (Article 35).42  
* **Resisting the Cover:** In the DMS case, the court refused to accept vague security claims, demanding proof that the surveillance was necessary and proportionate. This refusal to accept "security" as a magic word marks a significant departure from the pre-2010 judiciary.23

### **8.3 The Politics of Morality: LGBTQ Rights**

The Supreme Court's judgment in the *NGLHRC* case (registering an LGBTQ rights group) highlights the clash between constitutional rights and "political realism" driven by religious populism.

* **The Legal Argument:** The NGO Board refused registration, citing the Penal Code (acts against the order of nature). The Court distinguished between *being* (identity) and *doing* (acts), ruling that refusing registration violated Freedom of Association.43  
* **The Political Backlash:** Legislators immediately threatened to pass a "Family Protection Bill" to override the court. This illustrates the fragility of judicial protection for unpopular minorities when "political pragmatism" dictates that politicians must appease a conservative electorate.45

## **9\. Conclusion: The Fragile Guardianship**

The analysis of the last decade of Kenyan jurisprudence reveals a judiciary that has become the primary, and often lonely, arena for political contestation. The legislature, captured by the executive and "budgeted corruption," has largely abdicated its oversight role.

**Key Findings:**

1. **The Rise of Pretext Detection:** Kenyan courts have evolved a sophisticated capacity to detect "colourable legislation." Whether it is a surveillance system disguised as consumer protection (DMS) or a Presidential project disguised as a popular initiative (BBI), the courts are piercing the veil of form to reach the substance.8  
2. **The "Culture of Justification" is Operational:** The "duty to give reasons" regarding public participation is the most significant doctrinal development. It transforms participation from a ritual into a legal standard of accountability.3  
3. **Pragmatism as a Survival Strategy:** The use of suspended declarations of invalidity is a double-edged sword. It preserves the judiciary from immediate confrontation with the "Deep State" but risks normalizing unconstitutionality.

Ultimately, the Kenyan experiment is a battle between the "culture of justification" anchored in the judiciary and the "state capture" entrenched in the political branches. The courts have held the line thus far, creating a "two-track" reality where progressive jurisprudence coexists with regressive politics. The future depends on whether the "culture of justification" can migrate from the courtroom to the legislative chamber, or whether "legislative realism" will eventually suffocate the Constitution's transformative promise.
