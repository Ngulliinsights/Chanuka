# **Legislative Trajectory of Kenya (2010–2025): A Comprehensive Analysis of Constitutional Implementation, Fiscal Policy, and Structural Reform**

## **1\. Introduction: The Post-2010 Legislative Landscape**

The promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya in 2010 marked a definitive rupture in the country’s legal and political history, transitioning the state from a centralized executive system to a devolved unit with a bicameral legislature. The subsequent fifteen years, spanning the 10th to the 13th Parliaments, have been characterized by an intense legislative agenda aimed at operationalizing the Constitution's expansive Bill of Rights, restructuring the provincial administration, and defining the fiscal relationships between the National and County governments. This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the bills created, debated, passed, and rejected during this period, offering a granular examination of the legislative data to support schemas for tracking parliamentary efficacy and constitutional compliance.

The analysis draws upon a vast archive of parliamentary trackers, Hansard reports, and gazette notices from 2010 to 2025\. It dissects the friction between the legislature and the judiciary, particularly concerning the "Basic Structure" doctrine, and evaluates the socio-political impact of controversial fiscal and social legislation. By categorizing legislative instruments into constitutional amendments, fiscal laws, digital sovereignty frameworks, and social infrastructure bills, this report elucidates the complex machinery of Kenyan law-making.

**2\. Constitutional Amendment Bills: The Struggle for the Basic Structure**

Since 2010, the Constitution has been the subject of numerous amendment attempts, reflecting a persistent struggle between the political elite seeking to alter the structure of the Executive and civil society actors aiming to protect the document's rigidity. These attempts have tested the limits of Article 256 (Parliamentary Initiative) and Article 257 (Popular Initiative).

### **2.1 The Gender Principle Crisis: The Failed Amendments (2015–2019)**

One of the most protracted constitutional crises has been the failure of Parliament to enact legislation giving effect to Article 27(8) and Article 81(b), which mandate that no more than two-thirds of the members of elective public bodies shall be of the same gender. This legislative lacuna has prompted repeated judicial interventions and amendment attempts.

#### **The "Duale I" Bill (2015)**

In 2015, under pressure from a Supreme Court deadline, the then-Leader of Majority Aden Duale introduced the *Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2015* (National Assembly Bill No. 04 of 2015). The Bill sought to introduce a "top-up" mechanism to nominate the number of women necessary to meet the gender requirement if election results failed to achieve the threshold.1 The Bill was published on February 12, 2015, and matured on February 26, 2015\. Despite extending the constitutional timeline by one year under Article 261(2), the 11th Parliament failed to pass the Bill. It was lost at the Second Reading stage in 2016 due to a lack of quorum and sufficient "Ayes" to meet the constitutional threshold.2

#### **The Chepkonga Bill (2015)**

Simultaneously, the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) chair, Hon. Samuel Chepkonga, sponsored the *Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) (No. 4\) Bill, 2015*. This Bill proposed a progressive realization of the gender principle, effectively attempting to remove the strict five-year deadline set by the Supreme Court.2 Civil society organizations viewed this as a retrograde step intended to postpone constitutional obligations indefinitely. The National Assembly rejected this Bill in April and May 2016, with women parliamentarians arguing it diluted the affirmative action gains of the 2010 Constitution.2

#### **The "Duale II" Bill and Beyond**

A subsequent attempt, the "Duale II" Bill, was published as a compromise, introducing a sunset clause of 20 years for the special nomination seats. Despite being gazetted, the Bill was never debated and lapsed with the dissolution of the 11th Parliament in 2017\.5 The failure of these legislative initiatives led to the advisory by Chief Justice David Maraga in 2020 to dissolve Parliament for unconstitutionality—an advisory that President Uhuru Kenyatta did not act upon, but which remains a hanging sword over the legislature's legitimacy.

### **2.2 The Punguza Mizigo Initiative (2019)**

The *Punguza Mizigo (Constitution of Kenya Amendment) Bill, 2019* represented the first major attempt to amend the Constitution through a Popular Initiative under Article 257\. Spearheaded by the Thirdway Alliance Party, the Bill sought to address the ballooning public wage bill and over-representation.6

#### **Key Proposals and Legislative Path**

The Bill proposed a radical reduction of the size of Parliament, seeking to reduce the number of MPs to 147 and abolish the position of Deputy Governor to cut governance costs.7 It also proposed a single seven-year presidential term to cure the instability associated with five-year election cycles.7

The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) verified the 1.2 million signatures supporting the initiative, clearing it for debate in the 47 County Assemblies.8 However, the Bill faced insurmountable political opposition at the grassroots level. It required approval from at least 24 county assemblies to proceed to a referendum. By October 2019, more than 40 county assemblies had rejected the Bill.9 The Speaker of the National Assembly, Justin Muturi, formally pronounced the Bill lost on March 5, 2020, after receiving the returns from the county assemblies.9 The rejection was largely driven by the argument that the Bill would undermine devolution by reducing the number of representatives and that it lacked sufficient public participation prior to drafting.10

### **2.3 The Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) Bill (2020–2021)**

The *Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2020*, popularly known as the BBI Bill, emerged from the political truce ("Handshake") between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition Leader Raila Odinga. It proposed the most sweeping changes to the 2010 Constitution to date.

#### **Structural Proposals**

The Bill sought to alter the structure of the Executive by reintroducing the Office of the Prime Minister and two Deputy Prime Ministers, to be appointed from Parliament.11 It also proposed the creation of a Leader of Official Opposition and the establishment of a Judiciary Ombudsman, raising concerns about executive encroachment on judicial independence.12 Crucially, it proposed the creation of 70 new constituencies, a move that became a central point of contention regarding the IEBC's boundary delimitation mandate.13

#### **Legislative Trajectory**

The Bill followed the Popular Initiative route. By February 2021, over 40 county assemblies had passed the Bill, far surpassing the threshold of 24\.14 It was subsequently introduced in the National Assembly. On May 6, 2021, the National Assembly passed the Bill overwhelmingly with a vote of 224 to 63\.14 The Senate also concurred, setting the stage for a national referendum.

#### **Judicial Annulment and the Basic Structure Doctrine**

The High Court, in a landmark judgment on May 13, 2021, declared the BBI process unconstitutional. The five-judge bench ruled that the President, being a state officer, could not initiate a constitutional amendment through the Popular Initiative route reserved for private citizens ("Wanjiku").12 They further articulated the "Basic Structure" doctrine, stating that certain fundamental pillars of the Constitution are unamendable through the secondary constituent power of Parliament or popular initiative, and can only be altered by the primary constituent power of the people through a distinct, participatory process involved in constitution-making.16 The Court of Appeal upheld this decision in August 2021, and the Supreme Court delivered the final death knell in 2022, affirming that the President cannot initiate a popular initiative.18

### **2.4 The NADCO Bills and 2025 Amendments**

Following the contested 2022 General Election and subsequent civil unrest, the National Dialogue Committee (NADCO) was established to mediate political disputes. The NADCO Report, adopted by Parliament in February 2024, recommended several constitutional and statutory amendments.20

#### **Post-2023 Legislative Instruments**

* **The Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2024:** This Bill is currently under consideration and seeks to implement NADCO recommendations, including the formal establishment of the Office of the Leader of the Official Opposition and the Prime Cabinet Secretary.20  
* **IEBC (Amendment) Bill, 2024:** This Bill reconstitutes the selection panel for IEBC commissioners, a critical reform ahead of the 2027 elections.20  
* **Entrenchment of Funds (2025):** The *Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill, 2025* 22 seeks to entrench the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF), the National Government Affirmative Action Fund (NGAAF), and the Senate Oversight Fund (SOF) into the Constitution. This move aims to protect these funds from persistent judicial challenges regarding their constitutionality and separation of powers.24

**3\. The Fiscal Legislative Framework: Finance Bills and Economic Sovereignty**

The annual Finance Bill has evolved from a routine budgetary instrument into a highly contentious political tool, reflecting Kenya's escalating debt crisis and the conditionalities imposed by international financial institutions.

### **3.1 Finance Act, 2018: The Fuel Tax Watershed**

The *Finance Act, 2018* marked a turning point in Kenya's fiscal policy. Facing pressure to bridge the budget deficit and comply with IMF precautionary facility conditions, the National Treasury proposed the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) on petroleum products, which had been exempt for years.25

#### **Legislative Conflict**

The initial proposal was a 16% VAT on fuel. This triggered widespread public outcry and parliamentary opposition. In a chaotic session, Parliament initially voted to defer the tax. However, President Uhuru Kenyatta refused to assent to the Bill, returning it with a memorandum proposing a reduction to 8% VAT instead of a total deferral.25 In September 2018, amidst shouting matches in the chamber, the National Assembly failed to raise the two-thirds majority required to override the President's memorandum, allowing the 8% VAT to become law.25 The Act also introduced an excise duty on kerosene (KES 10.305 per liter) to curb adulteration and imposed taxes on mobile money transfers.26

### **3.2 Finance Act, 2023: The Housing Levy**

The *Finance Bill, 2023* was introduced against the backdrop of the "Hustler Nation" economic agenda. Published on April 28, 2023, and tabled for First Reading on May 4, 2023, the Bill proposed aggressive revenue-raising measures.27

#### **Key Provisions and Passage**

* **Fuel VAT:** The Act doubled VAT on petroleum products from 8% to 16%, significantly increasing transport and energy costs.29  
* **Housing Levy:** It introduced a mandatory housing levy, initially proposed as a fund contribution but converted into a tax following public pushback.  
* **Digital Content:** A new tax on digital content monetization was introduced to tap into the creative economy.28  
* **Parliamentary Vote:** The Bill faced stiff opposition but passed the Second Reading in June 2023\.31 It was assented to on June 26, 2023\. However, implementation was immediately stalled by litigation, with the High Court later declaring the Housing Levy unconstitutional for being discriminatory, necessitating a new specific Affordable Housing Act in 2024 to correct the legal defects.32

### **3.3 Finance Bill, 2024: The "Gen Z" Uprising and Withdrawal**

The trajectory of the *Finance Bill, 2024* represents a historic moment where civic action directly nullified legislative intent.

#### **Proposals and Protests**

Introduced on May 9, 2024, the Bill proposed VAT on bread, an "eco-levy" on manufactured goods (sanitary towels, diapers, electronics), and increased taxes on mobile money.30 These proposals catalyzed a youth-led movement ("Gen Z") that organized massive protests across the country.

#### **The Breach of Parliament**

Despite the protests, the National Assembly proceeded with the legislative process. On June 20, 2024, the Bill passed the Second Reading with **204 Ayes** against **115 Nays**.33 On June 25, 2024, Parliament passed the Third Reading. On the same day, protesters breached the Parliament Buildings, setting sections of it on fire and causing legislators to flee.

#### **Executive Withdrawal**

In response to the unprecedented unrest and loss of life, President William Ruto declined to assent to the Bill on June 26, 2024\. Utilizing his powers under Article 115(1)(b), he referred the Bill back to Parliament with a memorandum recommending the deletion of *all* clauses, effectively withdrawing the Bill in its entirety.32 This event underscored the limits of parliamentary sovereignty in the face of widespread public rejection.

### **3.4 Data Schema: Finance Bills Legislative History (2018–2024)**

| Bill Name | Publication Date | First Reading | Second Reading Vote | Outcome | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Finance Act 2018** | June 2018 | June 2018 | Aug 2018 | **Passed** (with Pres. Memo on 8% Fuel VAT) | 25 |
| **Finance Act 2023** | Apr 28, 2023 | May 4, 2023 | June 2023 | **Passed** (Assented June 26, 2023\) | 27 |
| **Finance Bill 2024** | May 9, 2024 | May 13, 2024 | June 20, 2024 (204 vs 115\) | **Withdrawn** (June 26, 2024\) | 33 |

**4\. Digital Sovereignty: Data Protection, Cybercrimes, and Identity**

As Kenya positioned itself as the "Silicon Savannah," the legislature was tasked with creating a regulatory environment that balanced innovation with security and privacy rights.

### **4.1 Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, 2018**

The *Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Bill, 2017* (National Assembly Bill No. 36 of 2017\) was introduced by Majority Leader Aden Duale. It sought to criminalize various cyber offences, including unauthorized access, cyber espionage, and child pornography.36

#### **Legislative History and Controversy**

* **First Reading:** October 2017\.37  
* **Assent:** May 16, 2018\.38  
* Commencement: May 30, 2018.38  
  Upon enactment, the Act faced immediate legal challenges. The Bloggers Association of Kenya (BAKE) filed a petition arguing that Sections 22 and 23, which criminalized "false publications" and "publication of false information," infringed on freedom of expression and were vague.39 The High Court temporarily suspended these sections.

#### **2024 Amendments**

In 2024, the Act was amended via the *Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes (Amendment) Act, 2024* to address emerging threats like crypto-fraud and SIM-swap scams. However, similar to 2018, the High Court suspended key provisions related to cyber harassment in October 2025 following a petition by the Kenya Human Rights Commission, maintaining the tension between state regulation and civil liberties.40

### **4.2 Data Protection Act, 2019**

The enactment of the *Data Protection Act, 2019* was a direct response to the government's attempt to roll out the National Integrated Identity Management System (NIIMS), known as *Huduma Namba*.

#### **The Huduma Namba Catalyst**

The government launched mass registration for Huduma Namba in early 2019 without a data protection law. Civil society litigated, and the High Court ruled that while registration could proceed, the data could not be used or made mandatory for services until a regulatory framework was in place.41 This forced the government to expedite the Data Protection Bill.

#### **Legislative Path**

* **First Reading:** The Bill (National Assembly Bill No. 44 of 2019\) was read for the first time on July 25, 2019\.43  
* **Public Participation:** The Committee on Communication, Information, and Innovation conducted public hearings across counties including Mombasa, Kisumu, and Nakuru in August 2019\.44  
* **Second Reading:** Debated in October 2019\.45  
* **Assent:** Assented to on November 8, 2019, and commenced on November 25, 2019\.46  
* **Impact:** The Act established the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) and aligned Kenya with the EU's GDPR. It gave effect to Article 31(c) and (d) of the Constitution regarding the right to privacy.46

## ---

**5\. Social Infrastructure: Family, Health, and Gender Legislation**

### **5.1 The Marriage Act, 2014**

The *Marriage Act, 2014* consolidated seven disparate marriage regimes (Civil, Christian, Customary, Hindu, Islamic) into a single statute, repealing colonial-era laws like the African Christian Marriage and Divorce Act.48

#### **The Polygamy Controversy**

The Bill, as originally drafted, contained a clause requiring a husband in a customary marriage to consult his existing wife before taking a subsequent wife. During the Committee Stage in the National Assembly, male MPs amended the Bill to delete this consultation clause, effectively allowing polygamy without spousal consent under customary law.49 This move caused female MPs to storm out of the chamber in protest. The Act was assented to on April 29, 2014\.49

#### **Ongoing Reforms (2023–2025)**

New legislative proposals in the 13th Parliament, such as the *Marriage (Amendment) Bill, 2023*, seek to introduce "divorce by mutual consent." This aims to move Kenya away from the adversarial fault-based divorce system (which requires proving cruelty, adultery, etc.) towards a more amicable dissolution process.51

### **5.2 Health Sector Reforms (2017–2023)**

#### **Health Act, 2017**

The *Health Act, 2017* was a landmark law that operationalized the right to health (Article 43\) and formalized the devolution of health services.

* **Legislative Path:** Passed by the National Assembly on May 25, 2017, following mediation with the Senate.52 Assented to on June 21, 2017\.53  
* **Significance:** It established the unified health system and defined the roles of the national policy-making apparatus versus the county delivery mechanism.54

#### **Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Bills (2023)**

The Kenya Kwanza administration overhauled the health financing architecture through a suite of bills assented to in October 2023:

1. **Social Health Insurance Act (SHIA), 2023:** Repealed the NHIF Act and established the Social Health Authority (SHA). It introduced three funds: Primary Healthcare Fund, Social Health Insurance Fund, and Emergency/Chronic Illness Fund.55  
2. **Digital Health Act, 2023:** Mandated the digitization of health records to improve portability and data management.55  
3. Facility Improvement Financing Act, 2023: Allowed public hospitals to retain and manage their own revenue to improve services.55  
   These laws faced initial resistance and court injunctions but began implementation in 2024, marking a shift from voluntary to mandatory health insurance contribution.

**6\. Electoral Reforms and Political Parties**

Legislative changes in the electoral sector follow a cyclical pattern, often occurring immediately preceding or following general elections.

### **6.1 Elections Act, 2011**

This foundational Act repealed the former National Assembly and Presidential Elections Act to align with the 2010 Constitution. It established the mechanisms for voter registration, nomination, and dispute resolution.57

### **6.2 Election Laws (Amendment) Act, 2017**

Following the Supreme Court's nullification of the August 2017 Presidential election, the Jubilee administration pushed through controversial amendments to the *Elections Act* and the *IEBC Act*.

* **Key Amendments:** The Bill mandated that if the electronic voter identification or transmission system failed, the manual register would take precedence. It also reduced the quorum for the IEBC commissioners from five to three and allowed the Vice-Chairperson to act as Chair.58  
* **Outcome:** Passed in October 2017 amidst opposition boycotts. The courts later ruled that these changes could not apply retroactively to the repeat election of October 26, 2017, but they remain on the statute books.58

**8\. Conclusion**

The legislative history of Kenya from 2010 to 2025 reveals a legislature under intense pressure to deliver on the promises of a transformative constitution while navigating the political exigencies of the Executive. The period began with a "legislative sprint" to pass foundational laws (Land, Elections, Leadership) required by the Fifth Schedule. It transitioned into a contentious phase dominated by constitutional amendment attempts (BBI, Punguza Mizigo) that tested the "Basic Structure" of the state.

Most recently, the focus has shifted to fiscal and social engineering through Finance Acts and Health Laws. The withdrawal of the Finance Bill 2024 stands as a watershed moment, signaling that the Parliament's legislative authority is increasingly subject to the direct oversight of the sovereign people. As the 13th Parliament progresses through 2025, the entrenchment of funds (NG-CDF) and the implementation of the NADCO report will likely dominate the order paper, continuing the complex dance between law, politics, and the people.
