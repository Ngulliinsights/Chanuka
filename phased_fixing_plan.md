# Phased Error Fixing Plan

## Overview
This plan addresses errors in the codebase based on the following prioritization:
1. Syntax Errors
2. Module Resolution Errors
3. Logic Errors
4. Type Errors
5. Other Configuration/Import Issues
6. Performance Issues

The plan is divided into four phases aligned with priority levels, ensuring critical issues are resolved first to prevent cascading failures.

## Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Syntax and Module Resolution Errors)
**Priority Levels:** 1-2  
**Estimated Timeline:** 1-2 weeks  
**Required Resources:** 2 developers, TypeScript compiler, Node.js runtime, code editor with syntax highlighting  

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Run TypeScript compiler (`tsc --noEmit`) to identify syntax errors
2. Review and fix syntax issues (missing semicolons, brackets, etc.)
3. Check import statements for correct paths and module references
4. Run module resolution tests to identify missing dependencies
5. Update package.json if dependencies are missing
6. Verify all files compile without syntax errors
7. Run basic linting to catch additional syntax issues

**Dependencies:** None (foundation phase)  
**Risks:** May uncover additional errors when syntax is fixed; potential for introducing new syntax errors during fixes

## Phase 2: High Priority Fixes (Logic and Type Errors)
**Priority Levels:** 3-4  
**Estimated Timeline:** 2-3 weeks  
**Required Resources:** 2-3 developers, TypeScript compiler, testing framework (Jest/Vitest), code review tools  

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Run full TypeScript compilation to identify type errors
2. Review logic errors in business logic and algorithms
3. Fix type mismatches and incorrect type annotations
4. Update interfaces and type definitions as needed
5. Run unit tests to identify logic errors
6. Implement fixes for identified logic issues
7. Add type guards and validation where necessary
8. Perform code reviews to ensure type safety

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 completion (syntax must be correct for type checking)  
**Risks:** Logic fixes may introduce new type errors; performance impact from added type checks; potential breaking changes to APIs

## Phase 3: Medium Priority Fixes (Configuration and Import Issues)
**Priority Levels:** 5  
**Estimated Timeline:** 1-2 weeks  
**Required Resources:** 1-2 developers, build tools (Webpack/Vite), configuration management tools  

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Audit configuration files (tsconfig.json, package.json, etc.)
2. Check import/export statements for consistency
3. Verify build configuration and bundler settings
4. Test environment-specific configurations
5. Update import paths to use consistent patterns
6. Fix any remaining import resolution issues
7. Validate configuration across different environments

**Dependencies:** Phases 1-2 completion (stable codebase needed for configuration testing)  
**Risks:** Configuration changes may affect deployment; environment-specific issues may be missed in testing

## Phase 4: Low Priority Fixes (Performance Issues)
**Priority Levels:** 6  
**Estimated Timeline:** 2-4 weeks  
**Required Resources:** 1-2 developers, performance profiling tools (Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse), monitoring tools  

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Run performance benchmarks and profiling
2. Identify bottlenecks in code execution
3. Optimize algorithms and data structures
4. Implement caching where appropriate
5. Review and optimize database queries
6. Minimize bundle size and loading times
7. Add performance monitoring and alerts
8. Conduct load testing to validate improvements

**Dependencies:** Phases 1-3 completion (functional codebase needed for performance testing)  
**Risks:** Performance optimizations may introduce bugs; over-optimization can reduce maintainability; may require architectural changes

## Dependencies Between Phases
- Phase 1 must precede all others as syntax errors prevent compilation
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 for reliable type checking
- Phase 3 requires Phases 1-2 for stable configuration testing
- Phase 4 depends on Phases 1-3 for a functional system to profile

## Potential Risks and Mitigation
- **Regression Risk:** Implement comprehensive testing after each phase
- **Scope Creep:** Stick to priority levels; defer non-critical issues
- **Resource Constraints:** Allocate developers based on phase complexity
- **Integration Issues:** Test integrations thoroughly after each phase
- **Timeline Overruns:** Build buffer time into estimates; prioritize critical fixes

## Success Criteria
- Phase 1: Code compiles without syntax or module resolution errors
- Phase 2: All type errors resolved; logic errors fixed and tested
- Phase 3: Configuration consistent; imports working across environments
- Phase 4: Performance benchmarks meet targets; monitoring in place

## Monitoring and Validation
- Daily builds to catch regressions
- Automated testing for each phase
- Code reviews for all fixes
- Performance monitoring post-implementation
